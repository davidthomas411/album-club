[12/14/23, 4:25:00 PM] Rory Edwards: Agreed this is class. Can here a bunch of influences. Was expecting something heavier from Neil's description and they do have a Maiden esque moment, but mainly hear Biffy and bizarrely Django Django.
[12/14/23, 4:25:35 PM] Rory Edwards: Love a band that can really bring a place or character to life and they have that in spades.
[12/14/23, 5:05:32 PM] Rory Edwards: This is really good too. Wistful stories, a lot of them seem to have a word of warning in them. Really liked the music too, somehow both nostalgic and modern.

Didn't know this was happening. Hope there's a tour!
[12/15/23, 4:56:33 AM] Neil Tilston: https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=pfbid0LQMWW4CQbmFGhda24oMBuWCRJZBRxDjdb2ZmHpXcGqMjqKKPG58st3qFv4w3obuZl&id=100044143674157&sfnsn=scwspwa
[12/15/23, 6:34:50 AM] Rory Edwards: This is ace. A lot more punk and a lot more personal than I was expecting. Style hops around but whether it is punky or poppy it's still really good. She never really seemed to feel loved or settled in her own skin which is a huge shame. Made some damn good music though.
[12/15/23, 6:40:56 AM] Rory Edwards: This getting the silent treatment it maybe deserves. It's patchier than I remember. I do think it's an interesting album both musically and culturally though. The voice of a generation of kids that didn't feel listened to while their self worth was being crushed by a political and corporate machine fully endorsed by many of their elders who were busy getting rich by doing nothing in particular.  They want the simple progress of their parents but "it doesn't exist" any more.
[12/15/23, 6:42:48 AM] Rory Edwards: Even other music fans (me included) sneer at them.
[12/15/23, 6:43:38 AM] Rory Edwards: This is a bit quieter and more introspective than some of their other stuff which allows the stupendous rhythm work to breath a bit more.
[12/15/23, 6:43:58 AM] Rory Edwards: Interestingly The Scratch use some similar stuff, lots of flattened snare.
[12/15/23, 6:44:12 AM] Rory Edwards: Please pan away.
[12/15/23, 6:44:17 AM] Rory Edwards: What's the score with bangers Neil?
[12/15/23, 8:54:28 AM] Neil Tilston: Glad you liked it. She was a very powerful artist and I think this album showcases that well
[12/15/23, 8:55:16 AM] Rory Edwards: Huge voice I should add. Not so sure about the choral number but definitely had the vocal strength.
[12/15/23, 8:55:50 AM] Neil Tilston: Yeah I remain unconvinced about this lot. People have many times told me they're great and how awesome Joey in particular is. Doesn't really do it for me . I think they have the odd good track. I like the one on this you'd picked before for singles club but the album as a whole is a bit of a slag.
[12/15/23, 8:55:59 AM] Neil Tilston: *slog!

Cleo Soul (almost certainly definitely maybe the lead singer on many of SAULT's albums) dropped two awesome albums this year. Really not sure which one is better. Here's one of them.
[12/17/23, 9:11:39 AM] David Thomas: This is a good theme. This is an unpicked fav and also definitely an oddity: ‎<This message was edited>

[12/19/23, 8:52:31 AM] Fergus Neville: Turns has Rory been leading a double life as Paul Simonon in The Clash for years

[12/19/23, 8:53:17 AM] Rory Edwards: I'll take that. Better than Mark Viduka.
[12/19/23, 8:55:02 AM] Rory Edwards: This was truly an an oddity. A King Creosote record that I liked.
[12/19/23, 8:55:56 AM] Fergus Neville: Huzzah!
[12/19/23, 8:56:17 AM] Fergus Neville: Glad I ground you down eventually
[12/19/23, 8:56:56 AM] Neil Tilston: He also looks a bit like Murdoch from Gorillaz here!
[12/19/23, 8:57:24 AM] Rory Edwards: Jaw line getting steadily more ridiculous.
[12/19/23, 8:58:11 AM] Rory Edwards: There is a technique used a lot in worship music called "pad string", which is essentially overlaying an automated set of violin or cello chords to give depth to a live song written by Bethel music's orchestra in a church where you have one man, a dog and banjo https://www.ableton.com/en/blog/pad-it-out-10-ways-make-distinctive-pad-sounds/#:~:text=Sometimes%20a%20pad%20sound%20is,want%20it%20to%20sound%20like.
‎[12/19/23, 8:58:44 AM] Neil Tilston: ‎GIF omitted
[12/19/23, 8:59:30 AM] Rory Edwards: For a lot of this album the "pad" seems to be most of the song but has been given so much love and attention it's beautiful. When he decides to drop a melody it lands hard as well.
[12/19/23, 9:00:50 AM] Rory Edwards: Lots about dealing with mortality, working your way through your shit, and relationship challenges. These are all themes I like to hear people write about.
[12/19/23, 9:02:21 AM] Rory Edwards: Didn't listen to the 30 mins of Bb at the end but it's continuation seems to suggest the story isn't finished. Frank Turner's album last year used a similar technique, ending on a clashing elongated chord.
[12/19/23, 9:02:41 AM] Rory Edwards: Liked the electronic ones most.
[12/19/23, 9:04:06 AM] Neil Tilston: I thought it was good but it droned on a bit at the end!

[12/21/23, 5:25:07 AM] Rory Edwards: Still not Whammed though.
[12/21/23, 5:26:06 AM] Rory Edwards: This is indeed an oddity. Dark and extremely 80s.
[12/21/23, 5:26:46 AM] Rory Edwards: In enjoyed its electroclash vibe. A bit like a poppy nine inch nails.
[12/21/23, 5:27:09 AM] Rory Edwards: My one issue with it is that a lot of the tunes didn't really go anywhere, say around waiting for a drop that never came.
[12/21/23, 5:27:27 AM] Rory Edwards: Might be a choice as they ramp up the tension.
[12/21/23, 5:27:33 AM] Rory Edwards: Still a cool record regardless.
[12/21/23, 5:28:20 AM] David Thomas: Yeah, agree with all of that!
[12/21/23, 5:29:09 AM] David Thomas: It’s probably obvious- but fever ray is Karin Dreijer, who was sister in the brother/sister band ‘The Knife’
[12/21/23, 5:29:45 AM] David Thomas: Similar jagged edgeyness here, but more synths
[12/21/23, 5:31:45 AM] David Thomas: It’s Trent Reznor moaning in the background! Good 👂 @⁨Rory Edwards⁩
[12/21/23, 5:43:41 AM] Neil Tilston: I enjoyed it for this reason. Felt very throwback to me. About 15/20 years ago I listened to a lot of the first two The Knife albums as well as the self titled Fever Ray album. It felt like catching up with an old friend. Thanks for getting me to listen 👍
[12/21/23, 5:46:49 AM] David Thomas: I also loved the knife - remind me bob Ogilvie who I think introduced me to them - did we see them live in Edinburgh?
[12/21/23, 5:47:09 AM] David Thomas: I missed the previous fever Ray album, so it was great to hear this on the radio
[12/21/23, 6:02:30 AM] Neil Tilston: A track from it was used as the title music on Vikings

[12/22/23, 4:49:38 AM] Rory Edwards: This is not my thing really, but has a genuinely beautiful vocal and a huge heart behind it. Rare you encounter a seemingly genuinely religious record not marketed as one nowadays, interesting to hear one. Really soulful stuff.
[12/22/23, 4:52:57 AM] Rory Edwards: Tumbleweeds for  my pick, which I've been enjoying having on while working but I didn't like as much on a close listen. Still cuts across club, R&B and soul genres in an interesting way. Lots about identity in there. Someone else liked it as it ended up 16th on the Gaurdian's album of the year list. I often agree with them but maybe not this time. Maybe someone liked their proper listen more than me.

Happy Xmas team x
[12/22/23, 10:45:11 AM] Neil Tilston: It's part of the fabric of album club that we must listen to this every year
[12/22/23, 10:50:22 AM] Neil Tilston: I quite liked it. It is somewhere between a club record and a bedroom record which is a bit unusual. It seems to have done well with the critics anyway -popping up on end of year lists all over.
[12/22/23, 10:52:24 AM] Neil Tilston: To be honest I love everything inflo touches. SAULT/L Simz/Michael Kiwanuka/Cleo Soul. It's all gold to me. Absolutely love the vibe. The bass playing ♥️.
[12/22/23, 10:56:45 AM] Rory Edwards: This is a tune. RIP one of them unfortunately.

Tim Armstrong got the band together for a new album this year. I've only heard one track so far but that was good so glad to have an excuse to pick this.

This is disappointingly not an Elvis cover
[12/23/23, 9:30:33 AM] David Thomas: Just listened to this on a plane,and loved it, very good for that specific tiredness/ floaty head feeling you get on planes. Loved the variation of the electro vs folk sounds. Susie Mullen a personal favorite. Great stuff.

Can really hear the influence of this on a lot of recent post punk stuff
[12/24/23, 9:14:29 AM] Neil Tilston: Especially Savages ☝️
[12/24/23, 9:22:53 AM] Rory Edwards: I think it's a rare example of a group coming back to do it's very best stuff. Intensely dark and edgy, both harks back to 80s stuff and influences forward. Not trip hop in the slightest, more Debbie Harry - the goth years.
[12/24/23, 9:24:28 AM] Rory Edwards: Machine Gun surely one of the great post punk tracks.
[12/24/23, 9:49:41 AM] Neil Tilston: So I think it's a very cool album. And I will always respect an artist who doesn't just rehash their previous sound with diminishing quality. They made something very unusual, exhilarating and experimental and it's pretty great throughout.
[12/24/23, 9:50:22 AM] Neil Tilston: But Dummy is their best work for me. Dummy is a 10/10 and Third is 9/10
[12/24/23, 9:54:44 AM] Rory Edwards: I heard Third first which is classic for thinking 'so.thetefore it's the best' but Dummy is a great record.
[12/24/23, 9:55:34 AM] Rory Edwards: Interesting that their original producer who is.give a lot of credit by fans didn't work on this. I wonder how much of the change was by invention and how much by necessity.
[12/24/23, 10:02:29 AM] Neil Tilston: Geoff and Adrian knows their stuff production wise. Been involved in many great projects separately from Portishead. I'd say the rougher production is an artistic choice rather than a necessity.

[12/26/23, 11:28:33 AM] Rory Edwards: Curious @⁨Neil Tilston⁩ had you or Cian heard the Guardians top pick for the year? An Irish folk effort I had never heard, have now though.

[12/26/23, 11:30:56 AM] Neil Tilston: Yeah I know it. My pal Cormac put me onto them. Nick Cave meets Irish trad in my top 10 for sure
[12/26/23, 11:32:19 AM] Fergus Neville: Did you not pick this?!
[12/26/23, 11:32:28 AM] Fergus Neville: It’s Uncut’s album of the year too
[12/26/23, 11:33:49 AM] Rory Edwards: A lazy accusation, too much stuffing clearly.
[12/26/23, 11:34:30 AM] Fergus Neville: Huh. I was sure we’d already had this or I would have picked it myself. Must have been my pal Mark who sent it to me.
[12/26/23, 11:34:44 AM] Rory Edwards: I was surprised I hadn't to be honest as it's very much up my street, surprised it's tipping critical lists though.

[12/27/23, 5:49:57 AM] Fergus Neville: I can’t find this on Spotify, so have picked a different Django/Stephane album as a proxy for Together Again. There’s not been enough gypsy jazz in album club as I’m sure we can all agree.

[12/28/23, 6:48:31 AM] Neil Tilston: Anyone else got a top 5/ top 10/ top 40 to share?
[12/28/23, 9:52:49 AM] David Thomas: This is wonderful
[12/28/23, 9:53:05 AM] David Thomas: Back at work with a post-travel cold, and this has cheered me up no end
[12/28/23, 6:11:26 PM] Fergus Neville: I might manage a top 5 at some point
[12/28/23, 6:12:54 PM] Fergus Neville: Yes! I bought the LP from Oxfam for a couple of quid because I liked their names and jaunty picture. It’s a great sound though and definitely cheering on a dreary day. Delighted you like it.

[12/30/23, 5:39:58 PM] Fergus Neville: Weren’t we meant to have done Friday bangers or something?

[12/30/23, 5:44:17 PM] Fergus Neville: Saturday
[12/30/23, 5:44:53 PM] Fergus Neville: I think you just killed singles club Dave
[12/30/23, 5:54:20 PM] Neil Tilston: I was never a fan anyway
[12/30/23, 6:00:09 PM] Neil Tilston: Probably need a new theme for the albums though. Is it me to
[12/30/23, 6:00:15 PM] Neil Tilston: ?
[12/30/23, 6:21:42 PM] Fergus Neville: I’m before you Neil. Have Dave and Rory both gone? No new album theme until I hear a bangers theme though dammit.  This club is one of the few remaining functioning institutions left. The UN, NATO, UK parliament, US judiciary and now this.

Here's a newish album I've been enjoying. Glaswegian jazz keeps getting better!
[1/1/24, 4:14:53 AM] Fergus Neville: Haha yeah, although I’ve been meaning to pick them since our friends Kev and Amina saw them in Fat Sams and said they were unbelievable

If you're enjoying Mary Wallpapers I can thoroughly recommend their hip hop side project
[1/4/24, 8:53:31 AM] Neil Tilston: It would be very easy to be critical of this. Very twee very schmaltz but much like the originals by ELO it's hard to not be absolutely charmed my the melodic beauty. Yes it has as much edge as a sphere but it makes me feel fuzzy and warm and I like it 👍
[1/4/24, 1:19:53 PM] Rory Edwards: I enjoyed it for a bit then found it a bit saccharine so had to do it in doses. Still good overall.
[1/4/24, 1:21:57 PM] Rory Edwards: Thought this was class. Love how folk sounds are having such an influence and the relevance of traditional themes to the modern day. Perfect fusion of the old and new for me.
[1/4/24, 1:22:49 PM] Rory Edwards: Thought this was class too. Sharp as fuck contemporary jazz record with pitch perfect production.
[1/4/24, 1:24:53 PM] Rory Edwards: Lat week didn't get much discussion but enjoyed BBC particularly which is nice given I hadn't really got on with them previously. Think this shares a lot of similar DNA. Clubby Cornershop.
[1/4/24, 2:53:06 PM] Neil Tilston: This grew on me. Originally felt a bit indie landfill in the vein of Animal collective etc. liked when it was a bit more ramshackle some of those bits reminded me of Scorpio rising era death in Vegas 👍
[1/4/24, 3:15:10 PM] Rory Edwards: Glad it won you round as I think it's a fair bit better than that. Find it very layered and rich which of course Death In Vegas have as well. Can here the Gallagher esque drawl as well.
[1/4/24, 3:15:31 PM] Rory Edwards: Don't think the indie scene is very strong in general right now.
[1/4/24, 3:15:57 PM] Neil Tilston: Feels more vibrant in Ireland than UK tbh
[1/4/24, 3:17:12 PM] Rory Edwards: Been blown away by some Irish records in recent weeks so fair play to them.
[1/4/24, 3:18:25 PM] Rory Edwards: The only permissable UK sounds at the moment should be a bit lost, a bit miserable or a lot angry anyway imo.
[1/4/24, 3:18:37 PM] Rory Edwards: Also banging jazz.
[1/4/24, 3:20:48 PM] Neil Tilston: And anything inflo touches
[1/5/24, 5:42:15 AM] Neil Tilston: Newish bangers? Or something else?
[1/5/24, 5:55:45 AM] Fergus Neville: Free choice with a new one if you can manage it

[1/5/24, 9:16:03 AM] David Thomas: Agree with all of this! Think I’m somewhere in between Rory and Neil - I like a good indie smorgasbord, but agree that this sounds best when it just sound like them noodling around, the ramshackle parts have more personality than the indie supergroup stuff
[1/5/24, 9:19:06 AM] David Thomas: Yes! Glad you liked it, had feared a panning, but was ready to stand by it for all the reasons you said. I don’t know the originals that much, so thoroughly enjoyed it. It’s possible that it’s not very good and the joy you get from hearing ‘don’t bring me down’ overcomes it all, but either way I’ve had it on a bunch at work when I’m feeling fragile. She’s got a version of ‘… sings the Police’ which I’m going to keep in my back pocket for the next ‘covers’ theme.

[1/5/24, 11:50:23 AM] Neil Tilston: @⁨Rory Edwards⁩ to blame
[1/5/24, 12:05:27 PM] Rory Edwards: Don't blame me. I was deeply confused by Neil's theme being 'anti establishment musicians that are dead and never got their due, particularly from Ireland or something interpret it as you wish'
[1/5/24, 12:05:35 PM] Rory Edwards: It shows in all my choices that week.
[1/5/24, 12:07:01 PM] Rory Edwards: Should have picked B3witched

I think we did a good job finding some of the best stuff out there on 2023. Looking forward to seeing what's ahead for this year. So pick an album from an artist who is due (either confirmed, rumoured or you're just hoping for a new record) an album out this year.  Obviously you'll have to pick one of their previous records.
[1/6/24, 10:22:40 AM] Neil Tilston: I'm shocked that I haven't yet picked Michael Kiwanuka. He's definitely due a new album. Here's his last one.

The vocal on this reminds anyone else of chvrches "the mother we share"?
[1/8/24, 9:44:34 AM] Rory Edwards: They do have similar voices now you mention it. Used very differently though.
[1/8/24, 9:45:50 AM] Rory Edwards: I thought this was ace. Heartfelt and just brilliantly put together. Interesting grief and rebirth narrative. What Moby would sound like if he was black and good at music

[1/8/24, 9:54:06 AM] Neil Tilston: I did but I'm definitely giving you pelters if you pick the Beatles
[1/8/24, 9:54:34 AM] Fergus Neville: I did actually consider that as a snidey pick, but then they did release something last year and it was shite!
[1/8/24, 9:55:34 AM] Neil Tilston: Apparently Dave is 💯% justified. New album scheduled for 29 March!
[1/8/24, 9:55:41 AM] Rory Edwards: I didn't think the song was too bad tbh.
[1/8/24, 9:56:03 AM] Fergus Neville: Yeah but then you don't like Moby
[1/8/24, 9:56:13 AM] Rory Edwards: Saw the video was directed by Peter Jackson and thought I would give it a watch. So unbelievably twee.

[1/8/24, 9:56:38 AM] Neil Tilston: I thought it was very poor
[1/8/24, 9:57:01 AM] Neil Tilston: I'd go as far as saying the new Liam Gallagher/John Squire track is better...
[1/8/24, 9:57:23 AM] Rory Edwards: Don't get me wrong. It definitely wasn't worth doing on any level.
[1/8/24, 9:57:31 AM] Fergus Neville: We've had to regrettably withdraw McCartney's invitation to play Newport
[1/8/24, 9:57:32 AM] Rory Edwards: Speaking of which...
[1/8/24, 9:58:18 AM] Rory Edwards: Bold move when venues are struggling to get the big names in.
[1/8/24, 9:58:49 AM] Fergus Neville: Not a bother to us. We've got artists battering doon the doors!
[1/8/24, 9:59:00 AM] David Thomas: Still time to delete this Neil!
[1/8/24, 9:59:50 AM] Fergus Neville: Only single figure tickets left for Constant Follower btw @⁨Rory Edwards⁩  if you can make it? 24th Feb.
[1/8/24, 10:00:03 AM] Neil Tilston: I'll happily own my mistake
[1/8/24, 10:00:19 AM] Neil Tilston: Always fun to do my googling out loud 😂
[1/8/24, 10:01:26 AM] Rory Edwards: So I can't make that one unfortunately. Marie is away multiple weekends in Feb and we're using all sorts of babysitting to plug gaps. Will end up not seeing each other for a month if we're not careful.
[1/8/24, 10:01:59 AM] Fergus Neville: Plenty more this year 😊

[1/9/24, 8:13:09 AM] Fergus Neville: Julie Eisenstain and Suse Bear are both rumoured to have new projects in 2024 which sound promosing. Probably more electronically than this grungy effort from 2016. It's really melodic and cool imo. Hopefully you haven't heard it before and like it.
[1/9/24, 8:13:33 AM] Fergus Neville: PS Suse Bear and Iain Stewart are both in Weird Wave

[1/11/24, 4:54:05 PM] Rory Edwards: Four very good albums this week I thought..Better late than never Ferg!
[1/11/24, 4:55:33 PM] Rory Edwards: Thought it was more consistent than Weird Wave without losing the variation.
[1/11/24, 4:55:59 PM] Rory Edwards: Liking all the stuff they're putting out tbh.
[1/11/24, 5:03:57 PM] Neil Tilston: I thought this was cool. Reminded me of Dehd
[1/11/24, 5:09:22 PM] Rory Edwards: Yes!
[1/11/24, 5:35:01 PM] Fergus Neville: Glad you all liked it!
[1/12/24, 4:38:56 AM] Neil Tilston: Same deal for singles. Or you can throw on something from this year if you have it!
[1/12/24, 4:41:43 AM] Rory Edwards: ‎This message was deleted.
[1/12/24, 4:43:12 AM] Rory Edwards: Wrong one. Hadn't realised there was more than one out.

[1/12/24, 4:44:28 AM] Rory Edwards: Apparently.thete are three out. Not sure if they'll all be on the album or not though.
[1/12/24, 4:44:51 AM] Neil Tilston: That's the title track of the album I think
[1/12/24, 4:45:32 AM] Neil Tilston: The Skinny has it as album of the month for January
[1/12/24, 4:46:14 AM] Neil Tilston: Think it's out two weeks today
[1/12/24, 4:46:52 AM] Rory Edwards: I'm not sure if it's a banger exactly, but it's a good tune imo.

[1/12/24, 5:08:07 AM] Rory Edwards: Pleased to hear Savage Garden finally managed to get on the property ladder
[1/12/24, 5:11:09 AM] Neil Tilston: Savage Mansion are high quality indie rock from Scotland. I've seen them live a few times in the last few years. Very good. They're on Lost Map and lead singer/driving force Craig was part of Weird Wave. He's also a Saints fan 🙌
[1/12/24, 5:15:53 AM] Neil Tilston: And he's almost definitely going to do a BRR show sometime 🤞

[1/13/24, 5:01:09 AM] Neil Tilston: Got a tune for yesterday @⁨Fergus Neville⁩ ?
[1/13/24, 5:55:56 AM] Fergus Neville: I got a saucepan for my 40th!
[1/13/24, 6:13:55 AM] Fergus Neville: It’s cast iron and is from Tennessee. Designed for cooking on fires!
[1/13/24, 6:14:21 AM] Fergus Neville: Working on a single, sorry. Had to turn off phone yesterday to avoid the United score until watching the game this morning.

[1/13/24, 6:24:29 AM] Fergus Neville: That was from weeks ago Dave! I absolutely love it, but don’t know much about it tbh. Heard it on the radio and sought it out. Neil and I had an argument over whether it was disco or gospel and settled on gospo as I recall.
[1/13/24, 9:49:38 AM] David Thomas: Lovely little story about this on the bbc - 'We need jungle' - Amol Rajan on how a University Challenge question spawned a remix craze https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-67955753
[1/13/24, 9:54:17 AM] Rory Edwards: I love quirky stuff like that.
[1/13/24, 9:54:26 AM] Rory Edwards: We on for a theme?
[1/13/24, 9:54:39 AM] David Thomas: All yours good sir
[1/13/24, 9:55:54 AM] Rory Edwards: Ok so having things on vinyl is.very new for me and I'm very much enjoying the pretentious novelty.
‎[1/13/24, 9:57:19 AM] Rory Edwards: ‎video omitted
[1/13/24, 9:57:47 AM] Rory Edwards: Dave I'm not sure if you have any vinyl. If you don't you can pick an album you wish you had on vinyl.
[1/13/24, 9:58:36 AM] David Thomas: Can someone go through the pros/cons of this for me? We need a new music set up in our upstairs bedroom/mini living room (currently listening to the radio on a 10yr old Alexa) - was just going to buy some Bluetooth bookshelf speakers, but open to being convinced to get something more
[1/13/24, 9:58:47 AM] David Thomas: Aye good un
[1/13/24, 10:00:17 AM] David Thomas: When/where do you guys listen to vinyl, and why not just stick it on Spotify? Genuinely looking to be convinced here….
‎[1/13/24, 10:00:59 AM] Neil Tilston: ‎image omitted
[1/13/24, 10:01:01 AM] Rory Edwards: I would say the pros are mainly aesthetic. Basically unless you're mixing it's all about how stylish a person you are.
‎[1/13/24, 10:01:51 AM] Neil Tilston: ‎image omitted
[1/13/24, 10:03:53 AM] Rory Edwards: Here's my pick https://open.spotify.com/album/1ww8GdNvrF0dgJbrnVZmAr?si=lxsjE8UmS5-qGG6Uh0csEw&context=spotify%3Aalbum%3A1ww8GdNvrF0dgJbrnVZmAr
[1/13/24, 10:04:17 AM] Rory Edwards: Would have picked the one I got from you Neil but want to listen to it on vinyl first 🤣
[1/13/24, 10:05:18 AM] Neil Tilston: Honestly a big part of it for me is I like record shopping. Going into the store and browsing talking to the staff talking about music and then investing in something. I think physically owning the record means you then have a kind of commitment to it that makes you more likely to pay attention when listening and look for enjoyment in it. This makes me more engaged as a music fan and less passive the way Spotify (and the skip button) let you be. I also like the big pretty artwork. And reading the sleeve note because I'm a massive geek .
[1/13/24, 10:06:15 AM] Neil Tilston: Another good reason. Many awesome records like that aren't available on Spotify
[1/13/24, 10:07:18 AM] Rory Edwards: Great way to support artists as well.
[1/13/24, 10:08:21 AM] Rory Edwards: I honestly feel bad about basically all listening being on Spotify they get less than a pittance from and there are only so many black t-shirts I can own.
[1/13/24, 10:09:15 AM] Rory Edwards: Good merch is rare nowadays I find. Very pretty records less so.
[1/13/24, 10:10:22 AM] David Thomas: This is what I remember of cd shopping when I was a teenager, saving up for weeks for a new release
[1/13/24, 10:11:35 AM] David Thomas: I’m seeing more and more merch being pushed through Spotify, maybe I should by more T-shirt’s too

[1/13/24, 2:32:02 PM] David Thomas: Album club all time top 5 albums contender?
[1/13/24, 2:52:45 PM] Fergus Neville: I’ve already posted this on here and no one laughed! Must have been the way I told it.
[1/13/24, 2:54:49 PM] Fergus Neville: Another reason I like vinyl is that some music genuinely sounds better. I don’t have a super expensive system and a lot of stuff sounds the same (or worse than CD/streaming, but I find that warm crackly records (folk/blues in particular) really come to life on vinyl.
[1/13/24, 2:55:21 PM] Fergus Neville: Shopping is a big part of it as others have said, particularly second hand crate delving for me (I’m a cheap skate)
[1/13/24, 2:56:04 PM] Fergus Neville: The only new vinyl I buy new really are from artists I’m seeing live when it’s as much a donation ‎<This message was edited>

[1/13/24, 5:23:38 PM] David Thomas: “He destroyed his family in the process…Fritz's family played a crucial role, contributing unpaid labor and enduring the transformation of their living space into a concert hall-like environment.”
[1/13/24, 5:24:16 PM] David Thomas: 35,000 watt amplifiers tho 🫡
[1/14/24, 3:22:01 AM] Neil Tilston: Definitely a good one for headphones whether listening digitally or on vinyl. There's certainly a lot of sounds moving from one ear to the other!
[1/14/24, 3:22:22 AM] Neil Tilston: Do you always listen to the whole album when you play this?
[1/14/24, 3:22:59 AM] Neil Tilston: I think side one has some incredible tracks and it's down to those that the record has such a great reputation
[1/14/24, 3:23:30 AM] Neil Tilston: But side 2 has some serious proggy wankery going on. It makes Pink Floyd look like a pink band!
[1/14/24, 3:23:45 AM] Neil Tilston: It's not bad at all and I actually quite like some of it
[1/14/24, 3:24:06 AM] Neil Tilston: This track being a case in point (also the closer)
[1/14/24, 3:25:04 AM] Neil Tilston: But it always feels a bit too self indulgent for me. That's why this album is just 4/5 for me. Still great but I wouldn't have it in my top 5.
[1/14/24, 3:47:03 AM] Fergus Neville: Pink Floyd were a pink band
[1/14/24, 3:47:37 AM] Neil Tilston: 🤦‍♂*punk
[1/14/24, 3:49:34 AM] Fergus Neville: Not even had my breakfast yet and have already made a satisfyingly snidey comment on Album Club. It’s going to be a good day.
[1/14/24, 4:09:26 AM] Neil Tilston: I know you're new to vinyl Rory so just wanted to check you know there's music on both sides  😜

[1/14/24, 4:13:09 AM] Fergus Neville: I don’t own it, but this Jack White album has so many nonsense but great vinyl touches
[1/14/24, 4:14:51 AM] Neil Tilston: Absolute madness for the sake of it. Fair play though a very reasonable price. Normally artists these days do that sort of nonsense on deluxe editions and charge a lot .
[1/14/24, 4:15:23 AM] Neil Tilston: If you like the album I'd say that's a very good deal
[1/14/24, 4:15:58 AM] Fergus Neville: I’d love to visit the 3rd Man plant in Nashville. Sounds like Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory! ‎<This message was edited>

[1/15/24, 9:45:35 AM] Fergus Neville: Ask your Teams meeting if they liked the last National record
[1/15/24, 9:45:51 AM] Rory Edwards: Most people are asleep already mate.
[1/15/24, 9:45:54 AM] Neil Tilston: Pretending to album club while working. Got your priorities the wrong way round there! 😂
[1/15/24, 9:55:07 AM] Neil Tilston: I think this is understandable at least the first two because of reasons.

1) in general most acts' first/early albums is/are better than their newest/latter albums (obviously there are many exceptions to this but I think it is more often true that way round than the reverse)

2) Often the album that wins you over to a band will be your favourite of theirs (again not always but probably true 50+% of the time)
[1/15/24, 9:56:08 AM] Neil Tilston: I think the fact that we all engage and listen to a lot of new music combined with these "reasons". Means thinking "I prefer their earlier stuff" somewhat inevitable.

Looks like I'm picking Jorge again!
[1/16/24, 2:36:18 AM] Neil Tilston: Have you picked anything yet for this week @⁨David Thomas⁩?
[1/16/24, 3:24:19 AM] Rory Edwards: I thought you had picked a single by him 🤣
[1/16/24, 3:24:29 AM] Rory Edwards: Christmas sponsored fail imo.
[1/16/24, 3:26:31 AM] Neil Tilston: So did I!
[1/16/24, 9:26:53 AM] Rory Edwards: Wanted to listen this week (on vinyl) before I came back on this one. Basically it depends on how much I've had to drink.
[1/16/24, 9:27:11 AM] Rory Edwards: More seriously though I think this is a classic and kinda stunned we hadn't had it.
[1/16/24, 9:28:16 AM] Rory Edwards: Very hard to define genre wise, brave and experimental, musically and lyrically deep, one (arguably two) era defining tunes on it.
[1/16/24, 9:30:19 AM] Rory Edwards: That said, f you're going to be brace you risk some stuff not landing with folk. My main criticism of it is that it doesn't quite hold together, particularly in the back half.
[1/16/24, 9:30:38 AM] Rory Edwards: What's it about? Lots of stuff.
[1/16/24, 9:32:05 AM] Rory Edwards: I don't think the placement of the two huge tunes helps it. I would have moved Hounds of Love to the end and had it as a culmination of her conversation with God or whatever is going on through the middle.
[1/16/24, 9:32:39 AM] Rory Edwards: Still 5/5 would listen again, and enjoy even more after a few whiskies.
[1/16/24, 12:07:43 PM] Neil Tilston: ‎Neil Tilston changed the group name to “First few tracks is plenty Club”
[1/16/24, 11:47:58 AM] Neil Tilston: So no. Not always.
[1/16/24, 11:48:12 AM] Neil Tilston: Cos the 2nd half is a bit naff/self indulgent?
[1/16/24, 11:48:58 AM] Neil Tilston: I agree there are tunes on the first half that absolutely soar. And agree the production is great. But I can't give 5/5 when I don't like the second half
[1/16/24, 11:49:13 AM] Neil Tilston: Interesting comparison to Low by Bowie which is similar in structure
[1/16/24, 11:49:58 AM] Fergus Neville: Just finished this myself! Enjoyed it a lot and I'm not sure I've heard the album all the way through before.
[1/16/24, 11:50:16 AM] Neil Tilston: But I love the arty flip side of that. He practically invents Mogwai's style of post rock but 20 years earlier.
[1/16/24, 11:57:43 AM] Rory Edwards: I can agree that the first side is stronger, whichever side of Night at the Opera Bohemian Rhapsody is on is also the strongest side of that album. Don't think I'm as put off by the experimentation of the back half as you are though.
[1/16/24, 11:58:13 AM] Rory Edwards: To be honest there are very few, if any, albums, I listen to all the way through every time.
[1/16/24, 11:58:24 AM] Rory Edwards: Might change now I have some vinyl 🤣
[1/16/24, 11:59:03 AM] Fergus Neville: That's grounds for Album Club expulsion! I hope you're not including our picks in that list.
‎[1/16/24, 12:01:01 PM] Rory Edwards: ‎GIF omitted
[1/16/24, 12:06:56 PM] Neil Tilston: So when you say an album is good you just mean the first few tracks are good and you don't really know the rest? 🤔
[1/16/24, 12:08:29 PM] Fergus Neville: Don't forget that Rory is significantly younger than us. The kids today don't understand the merit of albums, it's all about ringtones and the TokTik now. ‎<This message was edited>
[1/16/24, 12:08:47 PM] Neil Tilston: ‎This message was deleted.
[1/16/24, 12:18:42 PM] Rory Edwards: I'll make sure to let the Moana soundtrack play through next time we're in the car.
[1/16/24, 12:18:42 PM] Rory Edwards: Although that tune with the Rock on it is my favourite.
[1/16/24, 12:20:08 PM] Rory Edwards: 'Always' is a very high bar.
[1/16/24, 12:23:42 PM] Neil Tilston: Always is a very high bar but I would say 90%+ of the time I put on an album I finish it. Unless I'm not enjoying it. obviously life gets in the way and it's not always all in one sitting but I'll finish the album I'm on before moving onto the next one. Like I would a novel.
[1/16/24, 12:24:21 PM] Neil Tilston: Obviously sometimes I deliberately listen to a song from an album and didn't intend to listen to the whole thing so I'm not counting those.
[1/16/24, 12:30:57 PM] Rory Edwards: If I put on an album at home most of the time it will play out if I'm there for the duration. I would be unlikely to jump back into one though, except for club or if I particularly fancied it.
[1/16/24, 12:30:58 PM] Rory Edwards: I do think there is value in it - hence the record player - but I also enjoy skipping around and tiktoks and stuff.
[1/16/24, 12:30:58 PM] Rory Edwards: I will quite often do the best three or four tunes from an album without a modicum of guilt.
[1/16/24, 1:49:30 PM] Neil Tilston: So I guess my version of this is to use Spotify playlists. I have a lot of playlists for artists that would include those 4 tracks and not the rest of the record and I'll chuck it on shuffle.
[1/16/24, 1:50:44 PM] Neil Tilston: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7kdjoCOhGZjP8QzmtS01cK?si=BsM-Ax-oQO6y371oVvUgMQ&pi=e-CNZ0bdkLT2q-

I'd put this on shuffle rather than listening to my favourite GT tracks.
[1/16/24, 1:51:59 PM] Neil Tilston: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/55roMDNvZB97zQrfx5vFzv?si=O3UHXVatTCivuCNpgsdzCg&pi=e-L-7tZp7LT-i9

Sometimes I make bigger versions of these and include "related" stuff that could be influences or tracks that seem similar in tone or style to the artist like this one.
[1/16/24, 6:11:45 PM] David Thomas: admittedly i ranked this top 5 of all time after only listening to about track 5 or 6
[1/16/24, 6:12:24 PM] David Thomas: I also always listen to an album all the way through, except for all those other times when i don't
[1/16/24, 6:15:34 PM] David Thomas: apologies, bank holiday weekend here for MLK's birthday, and the mountains got 4ft of cold powder - skiving off work today was a great decision.
[1/16/24, 6:18:19 PM] David Thomas: If i had a vinyl collection, it would be 100% stinky old bargain-bin grandad vinyl, and this would be my pride and joy that i'd make anyone who came to the house listen to;

[1/16/24, 6:19:19 PM] David Thomas: spotify's discover weekly (where i found this masterpiece) is the second-hand-crate of my soul
[1/16/24, 6:19:59 PM] David Thomas: @⁨Rory Edwards⁩ you don't have to listen to this all the way through, but you should
[1/16/24, 6:22:22 PM] Neil Tilston: You're getting the idea!
[1/17/24, 1:02:04 PM] Neil Tilston: 🗞️🗞️🚨🚨📰📰
So I have some exciting news.

📻📻📻📻📻📻📻📻📻

I'm making my radio debut on Sunday! The Gunners DJs are getting a show on Dundee's internet radio station Jam city radio. Starts the Sunday night! More details and link to follow.

We'll be taking turns hosting (there's a core group of 6 in our collective) it'll be two or three of us at a  time and Germain Brian and I are taking the reins for our debut show this weekend!
[1/17/24, 1:05:27 PM] Rory Edwards: Will definitely listen to at least the first few tracks 😜
‎[1/17/24, 1:23:25 PM] Fergus Neville: ‎video omitted
[1/17/24, 1:24:19 PM] Rory Edwards: Someone get a remix on that last line.
[1/17/24, 1:26:55 PM] Fergus Neville: Taking the piss out of @⁨David Thomas⁩’ accent at the start was uncalled for imo
[1/17/24, 1:35:34 PM] Neil Tilston: Definitely playing Goat Girl now
[1/17/24, 1:37:32 PM] David Thomas: Taking requests??
[1/17/24, 1:38:00 PM] Neil Tilston: Possibly - vinyl only you see if i have it sure
[1/17/24, 2:02:53 PM] David Thomas: Was trying to find a copy of the roaches lp on eBay to send you, but no dice.
‎[1/17/24, 5:02:44 PM] Neil Tilston: ‎image omitted
[1/18/24, 9:15:45 AM] Rory Edwards: This is very good. A great sense of place which I like in a record. Could maybe have cut some of granny reminiscing about dying wool in the middle but I suppose grannies do tend to go on a bit.
[1/18/24, 9:16:51 AM] Rory Edwards: This is an album by Jorge Ben who I like a lot. I liked it the same a lot as his other albums. Very relaxing to listen to and good soundtrack to a very cold morning run.
[1/18/24, 9:20:24 AM] Rory Edwards: This was really interesting. Managed to be a bit punk while still drawing heavily from older styles, almost barbershop in places. Particularly liked the guitar licks which were all the better for their sparse deployment. A classic and you get the feeling very genuine story about trying to get out of a small town. A++ Would sound good on vinyl.
[1/18/24, 9:22:09 AM] Neil Tilston: I really liked that track! 😂
[1/18/24, 9:23:54 AM] Rory Edwards: Pretty sure it's the same Granny that features on Oasis Fucking in the Bushes. Very versatile performer.
[1/18/24, 9:24:48 AM] Neil Tilston: The ladie on fucking in the bushes sadly does not have a Kerry accent!
[1/18/24, 9:55:27 AM] Rory Edwards: Room for everybody here, yes, all are welcome.
[1/18/24, 12:39:32 PM] David Thomas: Yeah! It’s super punk-rock. I love all of it: the quirky monkey’s style introduction that’s super silly, followed by the absolute banger power harmony’s in the 2nd track. I love the way the harmonies blend into that electric guitar lick - and like Rory said love that it’s used so sparingly, just superb production. It super feminist and counter culture all round, the ‘Wet Leg’ of the late 70s. Folk, but wierd in the best way.
[1/18/24, 12:52:33 PM] Neil Tilston: I thought it was cracking as well. Never heard it before 👍
[1/18/24, 1:49:50 PM] David Thomas: Folk but wierd but not in a good way
[1/18/24, 2:11:45 PM] David Thomas: This was lovely, but I wasn’t disappointed when it finished. Fine for what it was - I listened on a run though, so might be better in a more intimate vinyl setting
[1/18/24, 2:34:36 PM] Fergus Neville: Yes, that was a poor choice
[1/18/24, 2:38:35 PM] Neil Tilston: Everything sounds better on vinyl 😜
[1/19/24, 2:16:52 AM] Neil Tilston: Same deal for singles @⁨Rory Edwards⁩ ?
[1/19/24, 2:46:03 AM] Rory Edwards: Nah free choice. Bang away.
[1/19/24, 2:54:27 AM] Neil Tilston: https://open.spotify.com/track/7qFEFcjmSAtODGtLYqraCq?si=owIvHwMaTVOPvla0aKar8Q

[1/19/24, 6:50:36 AM] Fergus Neville: I inherited A Hard Day's Night on vinyl from my Grandpa and always liked this track. It's very simple but effective I reckon.

[1/19/24, 8:45:44 AM] Neil Tilston: Great selection 👌
[1/19/24, 9:10:58 AM] Rory Edwards: Yeah that's a good tune imo.

[1/19/24, 4:42:45 PM] David Thomas: local banger
[1/19/24, 6:41:03 PM] David Thomas: Heard this on the radio earlier, but on a 2nd listen it’s pretty terrible, sorry guys!
[1/19/24, 6:41:51 PM] Neil Tilston: Par for the course mate 😜
[1/19/24, 6:42:57 PM] David Thomas: Should have just played safe and picked the fuckin Beatles or something
[1/19/24, 6:43:37 PM] Neil Tilston: 😂
[1/19/24, 6:43:56 PM] Neil Tilston: Here check out the ultimate geekfest that half of album club is involved in tonight

[1/20/24, 4:06:11 PM] Rory Edwards: We got a new theme yet?
[1/20/24, 4:12:27 PM] Neil Tilston: The details are pretty hazy tbh. Will update if/when I know more. It is absolutely an amateur operation - essentially Dundee student radio. My understanding is we'll be live from 1900-2000. You'll be able to listen online using any device with a web browser.
[1/20/24, 4:13:23 PM] Neil Tilston: https://www.justaddjam.co.uk/

That's the address. If you hit the ▶️ button it should work!
[1/20/24, 4:18:16 PM] Neil Tilston: I think it'll be available to "listen back" as well at some stage on mixcloud

[1/20/24, 4:19:35 PM] Neil Tilston: @⁨David Thomas⁩ after you right?
[1/20/24, 5:31:37 PM] David Thomas: Two big events in rock music this week, so pick your poison for the theme:
[1/20/24, 5:31:40 PM] David Thomas: https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/19/entertainment/dolly-parton-birthday-songs/index.html
[1/20/24, 5:32:49 PM] David Thomas: https://twitter.com/GreenDay/status/1748210427174039725

[1/20/24, 5:37:48 PM] David Thomas: (The Dolly Parton ‘Rock stars’ covers album might be worse than that weezer covers album, but someone should pick Jolene)
[1/20/24, 5:40:36 PM] Fergus Neville: Nice!
[1/20/24, 5:40:56 PM] Fergus Neville: So, what’s the theme exactly? New albums by established artists?
[1/20/24, 5:42:47 PM] David Thomas: No: Dolly Parton or Green Day
[1/20/24, 5:43:18 PM] Fergus Neville: That is a very specific theme
[1/20/24, 5:45:15 PM] Fergus Neville: I’ll go for this, although someone needs to also pick Dookie
[1/20/24, 5:45:20 PM] Fergus Neville: https://open.spotify.com/album/5dN7F9DV0Qg1XRdIgW8rke?si=GjDmLuULSQioBykMXVFF3g
[1/20/24, 5:53:43 PM] Fergus Neville: I’m picking American Idiot because it’s such a rare example of a band who looked to be petering out into obscurity as middle-aged men trying to sing songs about teenage experiences, who then write a truly brilliant and political album (which is still full of bangers).
[1/20/24, 5:54:29 PM] Fergus Neville: It’s still obviously the Greenday we all loved, but they found a way to move their music forward in a way very few other bands manage imo
[1/20/24, 6:02:24 PM] Fergus Neville: It’s courageous in terms of moving in a new direction, but also in being overly critical of Bush’s America’s war-mongering jingoism of the early 2000s. They took a lot of heat for it I think. ‎<This message was edited>
[1/20/24, 8:40:07 PM] David Thomas: I was joking, but let’s stick with it?
[1/20/24, 8:41:29 PM] David Thomas: I think similar to their new album (direct trump criticism) there was lots of pieces written about it being considered controversial, without any actual controversy

‎[1/21/24, 9:05:19 AM] Neil Tilston: ‎image omitted
[1/21/24, 2:01:09 PM] Rory Edwards: Spreading that sound...
[1/21/24, 2:02:18 PM] Fergus Neville: Mic’s cutting in and out for me?
[1/21/24, 2:02:49 PM] Rory Edwards: Working fine here.
[1/21/24, 2:03:48 PM] Fergus Neville: Mother-in-law isn’t enjoying the hip hop and language
[1/21/24, 2:03:51 PM] Fergus Neville: 😆
[1/21/24, 2:04:02 PM] Fergus Neville: Sounds great to me now though 👍
[1/21/24, 2:04:32 PM] Fergus Neville: She’d like some Leonard Cohen or Eagles please
[1/21/24, 2:21:01 PM] Rory Edwards: Ooh dramatic.
[1/21/24, 2:22:23 PM] Fergus Neville: Was worried it was the start of that 4 hour long Stranger Things soundtrack Neil picked once
[1/21/24, 2:26:31 PM] David Thomas: This sounds ace Neil
[1/21/24, 2:56:57 PM] Rory Edwards: Yeah well done mate, has been a really good show. Enjoyed all three sets tons.
[1/21/24, 3:49:29 PM] Neil Tilston: Thanks guys!
[1/21/24, 3:58:10 PM] David Thomas: You’ve a natural radio voice/style Neil, really relaxed and comfortable.

Here's a Dolly album
[1/22/24, 9:06:19 AM] Fergus Neville: I love Jesus of Suburbia, but the mid section sounds so much like Summer of '69 I just can't take it seriously
[1/22/24, 9:10:06 AM] Rory Edwards: I don't know to what extent you're meant to. Like the moment someone starts using the term "Rock Opera" you are expecting OTT.
[1/22/24, 9:11:53 AM] Rory Edwards: I don't think you have to justify picking American Idiot at all btw. I think it's a great record and really admire GreenDay for stepping into what then seemed a complete void of artists willing to write political music.
[1/22/24, 9:13:24 AM] Rory Edwards: And rock operas.
[1/22/24, 9:13:44 AM] Rory Edwards: Sorry I haven't picked yet, I've had a rough 24 hours filled with medical tests but it seems all will be well.
[1/22/24, 9:14:44 AM] Rory Edwards: Should I'm just pick Dookie or reinterpret the theme in a silly way?
[1/22/24, 9:15:27 AM] Rory Edwards: I could also pick one of the three or four GreenDay albums I have not listened to at all.
[1/22/24, 9:20:34 AM] Fergus Neville: Sorry to hear that. Hope all is okay 👍
[1/22/24, 9:27:41 AM] Neil Tilston: I suspect Dave wanted to listen to the new album from each artist so you could pick either of those?
[1/22/24, 9:27:55 AM] Neil Tilston: Same take it easy bud and keep us posted
[1/22/24, 9:43:21 AM] David Thomas: Hope you're ok @⁨Rory Edwards⁩, take it easy.
[1/22/24, 9:43:38 AM] David Thomas: Anything you're in the mood to listen to.
[1/22/24, 9:44:09 AM] David Thomas: from what i've heard of it, the new dolly parton album is terrible
[1/22/24, 9:45:42 AM] Rory Edwards: Let's do this. There is no chance I'm picking three hours of Dolly Parton covers https://open.spotify.com/album/7d3nOmFvL51roNElAdpi9d?si=tajBjlwJSPSa1RmD8bvOyQ&context=spotify%3Aalbum%3A7d3nOmFvL51roNElAdpi9d
[1/22/24, 10:14:28 AM] Fergus Neville: Yeah, it's so much more than just the singles. I hope you listen to this one all the way through Rory.
[1/22/24, 1:20:58 PM] Rory Edwards: Maybe since I picked it.
[1/22/24, 1:23:08 PM] Neil Tilston: But I thought Fergus picked it. Then you picked Insomniac.
[1/22/24, 1:23:24 PM] Neil Tilston: @⁨David Thomas⁩ still hasn't picked his own bizzare theme
[1/22/24, 1:23:39 PM] Neil Tilston: I'm guessing he's picking either of the new albums...
[1/22/24, 1:24:13 PM] Neil Tilston: Money was on Green Day until Rory's snide at Dolly. Reckon he'll go for that just to spit
[1/22/24, 1:24:20 PM] Neil Tilston: *spite
[1/22/24, 1:24:41 PM] Neil Tilston: Won't effect Rory though as he'll skip most of it anyway 😜
[1/22/24, 1:25:04 PM] Rory Edwards: Medical news quickly is. Been having stomach pain sometimes. Was very bad yesterday. They began prep for emergency surgery to remove appendix.Turns out not that. Bowell likely twisted instead. Will sort itself but be bloody painful in the meantime. Home.with turbo painkillers.
[1/22/24, 1:25:30 PM] Rory Edwards: May make.even less sense than usual for a few days.
[1/22/24, 1:25:58 PM] Neil Tilston: Aw balls man that sucks
[1/22/24, 1:26:18 PM] Neil Tilston: Hope it sorts itself soon!
[1/22/24, 1:32:02 PM] Rory Edwards: I've had better evenings but it did have its moments. Like the big dog consultant asking the junior doc whether he thought it likely a patient with an appendix that was about to burst could have completed a ten mile run that morning.
[1/22/24, 1:32:51 PM] Rory Edwards: Need sleep now. Should have picked differently 😜
[1/22/24, 1:33:57 PM] Neil Tilston: I got really confused by this for a second and thought you'd gone to the vet by mistake 😂
[1/22/24, 1:42:48 PM] Fergus Neville: Sorry to hear about your ailments Rory, sounds very painful indeed. Hope you feel better soon. I’ll try to think of a relevant theme for Friday.
[1/22/24, 1:43:10 PM] Neil Tilston: About bowels 🤔

[1/23/24, 8:57:55 AM] Neil Tilston: Meh 4.5/10
[1/23/24, 2:19:58 PM] Fergus Neville: That feels harsh to me. A solid 6.
[1/23/24, 2:30:35 PM] David Thomas: Yeah, I agree with both - meh, but fine. I also underrated American idio when I first heard it tho, so willing to give this a few more listens - which is lucky cos the kids have it on repeat
[1/23/24, 2:33:25 PM] Fergus Neville: Some belters on it imo. Perfectly acceptable record without being a standout in their cannon.
[1/23/24, 5:04:56 PM] David Thomas: Alistair says 8.75/10
[1/23/24, 5:09:39 PM] Fergus Neville: Who are we to argue with the youth
[1/24/24, 9:39:59 AM] Neil Tilston: Neil's Green Day albums ranked

1 = Dookie/American Idiot (9/10)
3 Nimrod (8/10)
4 = Insomniac/Warning/Kerplunk (7/10)
7 Revolution Radio (6/10)

Nothing else essential imo. 7 albums 6/10 or more is good!
[1/24/24, 9:40:47 AM] Neil Tilston: Imo this Dolly album is better than 2 of the three Green Day albums this week!

Tomorrow's bar graphs lesson sorted in this week's album club/work crossover!
[1/24/24, 10:14:31 AM] Rory Edwards: This is interesting given Red is probably Taylor's last somewhat country record. You can actually graph out her transition from Christian-ey country singer to pop superstar.
[1/24/24, 11:09:21 AM] Fergus Neville: I'm teaching our first years about data visualisation tomorrow and am definitely nicking this!

[1/24/24, 11:47:32 AM] David Thomas: Enjoyed revisiting this very much - such a distinct sound of the era, with lots of memories attached. never my favorite album, and the production is terrible but adds to the charm, but a quality follow up to Dookie - much more angry and gritty (jaded?) with the drums turned up far too loud, certainly not chasing fame and pop-stardom which easily could have been the case after MTV played basketcase to death.
[1/24/24, 11:47:47 AM] David Thomas: @⁨Rory Edwards⁩ hope you're feeling better?

[1/24/24, 1:15:46 PM] Neil Tilston: Codeine ftw
[1/25/24, 9:25:22 AM] Rory Edwards: 5/10 for Saviours for me. It had some good tunes on it. A bit pop punk in places but I'm not averse to that particularly. Only cringed once when they were singing about "busted hearts" and from then on all I could hear that tune was Busted. My main issue with it is that it isn't coherent, forgot that it was meant to be a political record one song in then only remembered for the last few tunes.
[1/25/24, 9:25:46 AM] Rory Edwards: Closing sequence the strongest by a distance, an odd feature of Greenday records.

[1/25/24, 4:42:30 PM] Rory Edwards: Agree this was.better than at least two of three albums this week. If we had been born a different time and/or gender I think we might be saying 3/3.
[1/25/24, 4:46:32 PM] Rory Edwards: Incredible to hear the roots of the greatest ever feminist class anthem shining through her earlier work. The impact of poverty, the role model of her mother, the largely fleeting presence of men.
[1/25/24, 4:46:49 PM] Rory Edwards: Sounded great too, just on that edge between blues and country.

[1/27/24, 4:43:14 PM] Fergus Neville: Great picks
[1/27/24, 4:54:42 PM] Fergus Neville: A pal of mine was in negotiations to bring JCC to the Rio in Newport for a matinee show before a Dundee gig. Didn’t come off in the end sadly as that would have been quite the spectacle.
[1/27/24, 5:59:21 PM] Neil Tilston: I have something but it's not on Spotify. Can you guys bear a YouTube stream? Album's only 30 mins. Obviously I'll forgo a playlist track.

[1/31/24, 3:38:55 PM] Rory Edwards: Can someone tell me why they enjoy the Arctic Monkeys? I just don't really get it. Album has its moments, almost R&B in places, but meh. I like the cover art.
[1/31/24, 3:39:38 PM] Rory Edwards: Hard Fi but vaguely grittier.
[1/31/24, 3:40:19 PM] Fergus Neville: There have been some bad takes on here in the past 3 years, but I can't remember a worse one than this!
[1/31/24, 3:40:23 PM] Fergus Neville: 👏
[1/31/24, 3:45:55 PM] Rory Edwards: I have been reading the lyric and it's ok. Paints a picture at least. They are functionally the same to me though. I won't be putting either on anytime soon.
[1/31/24, 3:48:03 PM] Rory Edwards: They also both have tunes about needing to get cash out. Not sure if Hard Fi does receipts.
[1/31/24, 4:28:59 PM] Neil Tilston: In one sense I agree with Rory. I've never considered myself an Arctic Monkeys fan. Not that I hated them just felt for a long while there that I heard them plenty just in general life/media without ever seeking them out . When I saw Dave had picked them my personal response was lukewarm. But I actually enjoyed it more than I thought. Felt the tracks really held up. I don't imagine I'll suddenly be listening to them loads but it's a solid 7.5/10 from me 👍
[1/31/24, 4:29:49 PM] Neil Tilston: This was even better than I remembered! Will be tracking down a hard copy. ❤️
[1/31/24, 4:30:48 PM] Neil Tilston: Great album is still great. They made a real go at being the next simple minds here and deserved to pull it off. It made them big but nearly made them huge. Pulled off going a bit FM but not losing what made them them.
[1/31/24, 4:31:28 PM] Neil Tilston: This was just lovely. A bit gutted we won't get Scott's beautiful guitar playing as part of the Newport show now .
[1/31/24, 4:58:34 PM] David Thomas: the arctic monkeys are an absolute national treasure, and this level of apathy from half the group qualifies as 'creative differences' that the club might not survive.
[1/31/24, 5:05:25 PM] David Thomas: I remember being astounded by Rory's negative opinions of th'artcics previously, and assumed it was cos he'd never listened past the singles. I'm not saying this is a great album, but its a solid 4th (5th?) album from a group that have grown from bratty northern teenagers with a massive hit, into lyrically and musically literate (poetic?) indie rock stalwarts that i would listen to any time.  would happily stick this on at home, at work, on the run, just great music all round. the hard-fi comparison is exactly why they are great - hard-fi never graduated from making that one sound that people liked that one time; this is mature songwriter making music that they like
[1/31/24, 5:12:39 PM] Fergus Neville: Preach Strims!
[1/31/24, 5:14:48 PM] Fergus Neville: I didn’t particularly warm to AM in first listen when it came out because I loved their bratty debut so much (played the kids ‘Dancefloor today and they predictably lost their minds) but that makes me love this album even more now it’s grown on me. It’s just so atmospheric and smouldering.
[1/31/24, 5:15:31 PM] Fergus Neville: Hard Fi were fucking gash btw! Even that one single was rotten.
[1/31/24, 5:15:55 PM] Fergus Neville: You’ll be comparing Radiohead with the Bravery next or some such
[1/31/24, 5:21:16 PM] Fergus Neville: Rory can blame his ropey review on weapons grade painkillers. What’s your excuse?

Finally available to listen back!
[2/1/24, 4:08:07 AM] Rory Edwards: Wow, Arctic Monkeys fans seem really passionate.
[2/1/24, 4:15:37 AM] Rory Edwards: To be clear I don't dislike them. The record was fine and had some high points, particularly like Arabella. It just didn't excite me much, which is weird because it seems to excite a lot of other people.
[2/1/24, 4:20:52 AM] Rory Edwards: As a lot of my output on here will show I like albums to be about some big idea at the core, and one of the reasons I think I struggle with them slightly is that their albums seem to be more collections of short stories. I can see what the idea is meant to be in some cases, but for whatever reason I struggle to relate.
[2/1/24, 4:26:38 AM] Rory Edwards: People's over-enthusiasm then puts me on the defensive and I resort to putting my tongue in my cheek.
[2/1/24, 4:26:55 AM] Rory Edwards: I imagine people's reaction when I talk about Biffy is vaguely similar.
[2/1/24, 5:37:29 AM] Fergus Neville: 👍
[2/1/24, 5:37:47 AM] Fergus Neville: All in jest Rory, a good ruck on here every once in a while is cathartic!

[2/2/24, 3:31:17 PM] Rory Edwards: Standard.
[2/2/24, 3:33:46 PM] David Thomas: Rory getting into the spirit of the upcoming TaylorBowl
[2/2/24, 3:34:28 PM] David Thomas: https://www.npr.org/2024/02/01/1228373511/heres-why-conspiracy-theories-about-taylor-swift-and-the-super-bowl-are-spreadin
[2/2/24, 3:37:48 PM] Fergus Neville: Swift’s politics are definitely in play though. I heard it discussed on a UK political podcast this week. There was a poll suggesting that 20% of Americans said they’d be influenced in how to vote if she endorsed either side. Given that Biden is doing particularly badly with young people (his age, Gaza) she really could be critical to the election, and thus the world order.
[2/2/24, 3:45:56 PM] Rory Edwards: Taylor is simply one of the most important artists of this generation. Culturally, musically, the whole lot. It's getting on for Beatlemania levels of carnage.
[2/2/24, 3:46:32 PM] Fergus Neville: (I still don’t really get it…)
[2/2/24, 3:46:49 PM] Fergus Neville: Maybe this record will change my mind. I genuinely hope so.
[2/2/24, 3:47:18 PM] Rory Edwards: I think she's brilliant but I won't tell you what you should like 😘
[2/2/24, 3:48:08 PM] Fergus Neville: Arctic Monkeys > Weezer > Taylor Swift > Hard-Fi
[2/2/24, 3:49:13 PM] Fergus Neville: This is a genuine q. What should I be listening out for in Midnights?
[2/2/24, 3:51:04 PM] David Thomas: Definitely make sure you listen out for the concept of nocturnal ruminations inspired by her sleepless nights
[2/2/24, 3:51:36 PM] David Thomas: I’d keep an ear out for exploring emotions such as regrets, self-critique, fantasies, heartbreak, and infatuation, using confessional yet cryptic lyrics that allude to her personal life and public image.
[2/2/24, 3:51:39 PM] Rory Edwards: A pop and electro powerhouse wrestling poetically with her approaching midlife in the early, trying to work out who she is after finally getting over her first love. You can't miss her.
[2/2/24, 3:52:02 PM] David Thomas: She the one singing on most of the tracks I think
[2/2/24, 3:52:35 PM] Rory Edwards: And giving a voice to a lot of women as well..
[2/2/24, 3:55:05 PM] Rory Edwards: I think there is some footage of Swift arguing with her team about endorsing Hilary, she wanted to, they advised against. Not sure how that plays into the current contest though, she is far more confident than she was but Gaza and the fact the nutjob bit of the right already have her down as public enemy number 267 makes it tricky.
[2/2/24, 3:56:07 PM] David Thomas: She endorsed biden last time
[2/2/24, 3:57:23 PM] David Thomas: https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/31/politics/taylor-swift-documentary-marsha-blackburn/index.html
[2/2/24, 3:58:18 PM] David Thomas: She came out against her local senator a few years ago, I think that was the footage in her documentary I’ve seen where her dad was against it.
[2/2/24, 3:59:20 PM] Fergus Neville: 👍👍

[2/5/24, 3:16:26 PM] David Thomas: Aoife will be thrilled 🐐 ‎<This message was edited>
[2/5/24, 3:21:24 PM] Fergus Neville: She’ll be angrier at your spelling than the lineup I’ll wager
[2/5/24, 9:13:01 PM] David Thomas: Yeah, I agree. I was really excited to hear it, the two singles I’ve heard are great (‘sinner’ and ‘nothing matters’), but there’s not much there beyond that, solid 5/10. Really pretty and pleasing but not much substance and a lot of vague warbling. They should do a collaboration with Witch Fever, the combination would be better than both their sounds.
[2/5/24, 9:13:28 PM] David Thomas: This is great.
[2/5/24, 9:15:28 PM] David Thomas: I actually think I got the Last Dinner Party mixed up  with a few other bands that all have similar tracks out at the moment (‘Blondshell’ being one - and the other one I can’t remember who but their one song is great), and was hoping for more of the grittier sound, but that’s not really their fault I guess

[2/6/24, 6:48:05 AM] Rory Edwards: I like it, listened to it after they won some up and coming award for the BBC, enjoyed it more this time, Kate Bush and Florence vibe, really cool drumming.
[2/6/24, 6:49:34 AM] Rory Edwards: It's not heavy hitting, which is a bit of a pity as the band name and track title all point to hardcore climate nihilism, but it is enjoyable.
[2/7/24, 11:10:54 AM] Fergus Neville: I enjoyed this more than you too Dave! I think I'd maybe heard Caesar on a TV screen before but nothing else. Was just thinking it could be a good record for the whole family to enjoy until Nothing Matters. Ah well. Kate Bush and Florence my obvious go to refs too. Great pick!
‎[2/7/24, 11:18:38 AM] Fergus Neville: ‎image omitted
[2/7/24, 11:44:43 AM] David Thomas: I like it too, just not wowed by it. Lacking the vocal power of Flo, and the weirdness of Kate.
[2/8/24, 4:05:29 AM] Rory Edwards: I think I had listened to this back in the day but not for a long time. Quite enjoyed it and found it a great album to work to. It has that quality of being a pleasing background piece but also more intricate and detailed when you focus in. Ahead of it's time as well imo. Can only think of Radiohead that were trying to make indie records with layered sound like this around then.
[2/8/24, 4:07:38 AM] Rory Edwards: Pick as much of it as you like. I'm loving all of it. This my favourite so far in how it managed to both be one thing and change the mood so effectively - great playful energy in places, solemn and reflective in others, vaguely folky occasionally. Very good.
[2/8/24, 4:27:16 AM] Neil Tilston: I agree it's great but I think many great bands made similar stuff around this time. Early verve? sterolab? And then it was only a year or two till the second wave of post rock (mogwai, godspeed, sigur Ros etc) kicked off. 

Certainly that style wasn't trendy as it was the start of britpop and this more cerebral style of rock was often dismissed as boring or lifeless by the music press of the time.
[2/8/24, 4:42:14 AM] Rory Edwards: And so we come to Taylor.
[2/8/24, 4:42:36 AM] Rory Edwards: I can’t work out if this is my fourth or fifth favourite album by her.
[2/8/24, 4:42:52 AM] Rory Edwards: I picked it because 1. Everyone has heard her very biggest hits a million times and I didn’t want a discussion dominated by the merits of We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together at the expense of the rest of either Red of 1984 which are both stonking records 2. Taylor’s story – particularly her roots in country music culture and breakup with Jake Gyllenhaal – have coloured all her music and this tour of her midnight hopes, fears and regrets give you an insight into all of that. 3. It is a fantastic electro-pop record in its own right, has a side of RnB for @Dave to enjoy, and seems to mark a further transition into something new.
[2/8/24, 4:43:14 AM] Rory Edwards: Taylor is a fantastic lyricist and that comes across throughout this record. There is earworm one liners, poetic grace and even a Stephen King reference. “Anti-Hero” is a beautifully raw law look at self confidence and “You’re on your own kid” manages to be both heartbreaking and empowering. I seriously think one day people will talk about her like Joni Mitchell or Dolly Parton, a generational significant song-writing talent and feminist icon.
[2/8/24, 4:43:28 AM] Rory Edwards: I love the understated but pitch perfect production. It’s varied while holding together well, has loads of interest under the bonnet and turns the ratchet on tunes at just the right time steadily building throughout the album. If it was me I might have gone up a level again but I probably would have wrecked it.
[2/8/24, 4:43:41 AM] Rory Edwards: The record deals with some big stuff – love, self loathing, the realities of fame and the pressures of responsibility. At the end we seem to have a Taylor that sees her demons eye-to-eye, has truly moved on from heartbreak, realises mega-fame isn’t all that and comes with responsibilities, but perhaps most importantly understands she can do whatever the fuck she wants.
[2/8/24, 4:44:00 AM] Rory Edwards: Her music is giving perhaps millions of women and probably some men a template to take a similar journey. My wife talks about “channelling Reputation Taylor” when she is facing up to something difficult.
[2/8/24, 4:44:15 AM] Rory Edwards: If you would like to talk to someone even more obsessed that me I can direct you to either her or Jen.
[2/8/24, 4:44:54 AM] Rory Edwards: They would have had to submit their reviews as .pdfs
[2/8/24, 4:44:57 AM] Rory Edwards: Fin
[2/8/24, 8:03:00 AM] David Thomas: Brilliant Rory
[2/8/24, 8:18:37 AM] Fergus Neville: Yes, excellent. Probably enjoyed the review more than the album.
[2/8/24, 9:18:43 AM] Rory Edwards: Those interested in exploring Taylor further may find the Era's setlist a good starting point https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6qSYIKJihVKpWr2HDeHjxS?si=JwPheTRTTXuruMPrkTvjJg&pi=e-rKQa6wclQXyp
[2/8/24, 9:20:35 AM] Rory Edwards: My personal highlights include Ready for It and Look What You Made Me Do from the patchy Reputation and the epic ballad All to Well about Gyllenhaal which many consider Taylor's best tune.
[2/8/24, 9:20:54 AM] Rory Edwards: One miss was State of Grace which sounds a bit like James. Apparently she does play it sometimes.
[2/8/24, 9:22:04 AM] Rory Edwards: Look out for Taylor tropes like Red/Blood references which often refer to her past or Gyllenhaal and mentions of cardigans which is a popular knitwear item.
‎[2/8/24, 9:29:45 AM] David Thomas: ‎image omitted
[2/8/24, 9:39:18 AM] Fergus Neville: I don't have anything against her at all (particularly if she does the honourable thing and buries Trump)
[2/8/24, 9:41:58 AM] Rory Edwards: I hope she does but even for someone in her position I think it would be a genuinely brave thing to do. The backlash would likely last her whole life.
[2/8/24, 9:43:58 AM] Fergus Neville: It's true, and it's not fair to put all that pressure on her. But America is facing a genuinely existential threat from Trump. I've never forgiven Michael Jordan for not supporting the campaign in support of black people who were being murdered by cops because "white people buy sneakers too".

[2/8/24, 9:53:43 AM] Neil Tilston: All 4!
[2/8/24, 9:53:57 AM] Neil Tilston: I'm looking forward to her post rock/shoegaze phase
[2/8/24, 9:54:05 AM] Rory Edwards: No one counts Britpop mate.
[2/8/24, 9:55:56 AM] Neil Tilston: My feelings re Taylor Swift's music are similar to those for Arctic monkeys. I don't think it's bad at all but I never feel the need to look for it. There are other artists who in my opinion do similar things better. I'm not hating at all it's just not going to hit the top of my pile.
[2/8/24, 9:56:33 AM] Neil Tilston: I couldn't have told you before today that she and Jake gyllenhall were an item so that kind of passed over my head.
[2/8/24, 9:57:03 AM] Neil Tilston: The political angle is interesting but doesn't seem to influence the record at all - at least not to my ear.
[2/8/24, 9:57:46 AM] David Thomas: Finish him @⁨Rory Edwards⁩
[2/8/24, 9:57:47 AM] Neil Tilston: Absolutely adored this. Will be listening a lot more in preparation for that co headline mogwai festival (tickets go on sale tomorrow)
[2/8/24, 9:58:02 AM] David Thomas: (I actually also didn’t know this)
[2/8/24, 9:58:38 AM] Fergus Neville: Me 3! 🙋‍♂
[2/8/24, 9:59:02 AM] Rory Edwards: He has to learn he has bad taste for himself.
[2/8/24, 9:59:47 AM] Neil Tilston: There was a wee double hit of two tracks in a row on the record I thought we're particularly strong and would elevate the score above 7/10 to 8/10 hang on and I'll look back for the titles.
[2/8/24, 10:00:34 AM] Neil Tilston: Question...
Vigilante shit
[2/8/24, 10:00:50 AM] Neil Tilston: Those two were top stuff. Reminded me of Anna Calvi
[2/8/24, 10:01:19 AM] Neil Tilston: I listened to Hunter by Anna Calvi after actually. That's a great album!
[2/8/24, 10:01:39 AM] Neil Tilston: I have to teach now
[2/8/24, 10:01:40 AM] Neil Tilston: Ttyl
[2/8/24, 10:03:10 AM] Rory Edwards: Both quite Reputation which is interesting. It isn't loved by critics. I must also actually do some work.
[2/8/24, 11:13:37 AM] Neil Tilston: What does "both quite reputation" mean?
[2/8/24, 11:16:03 AM] Rory Edwards: They sound similar to stuff off reputation

[2/8/24, 12:21:19 PM] Neil Tilston: Have reflected and decided the ska punk album will be the best 👍
[2/8/24, 12:23:32 PM] Neil Tilston: This is quite cool. Someone has made a list themselves of basically every song sampled by the beastie boys:

https://www.alohamiscreant.com/p/beastie-boys-sample-source-collection.html?m=1
[2/8/24, 2:13:12 PM] David Thomas: I don't think i've heard many of her songs before this came out - other than the other album you picked, i just don't seem to come across anything she's played, its not played on the radio etc.
[2/8/24, 2:15:41 PM] David Thomas: given this, midnights is my favorite album by far, i think i prefer the electro-pop to the country style for sure.  maybe its because its RnB that i like it, but i suspect its the Jack Antonoff (him off of Bleachers) production/song-writing that i really like
[2/8/24, 2:17:24 PM] David Thomas: theres a little tiny voice at the back of my head that says all her best recent songs have been written/produced by Antonoff, and that her other stuff is extremely simple and not actually that good...
[2/8/24, 2:17:44 PM] David Thomas: but i don't listen to that voice, and i certainly don't say that out loud to anyone
‎[2/8/24, 2:19:02 PM] David Thomas: ‎image omitted
[2/8/24, 2:21:39 PM] Rory Edwards: Yeah don't listen to that guy. Knowing a little about your taste I would check out Red which is Olivio Rodrigo before she was a thing. Reputation is the other electro pop record but it's much more clubby than Midnights.

[2/8/24, 2:56:28 PM] Neil Tilston: Dave didn't even like it
[2/8/24, 2:57:11 PM] Rory Edwards: Aig of good music how it grows on you imo 🤣
[2/8/24, 2:57:43 PM] Neil Tilston: We were apparently far more interested in the Playoff of best songs from 69 love songs that Dave was running at the time! 😂

[2/9/24, 2:52:17 PM] Neil Tilston: Should have Rory get two picks given he picked an album we'd had before.? Or is that just allowed now. We're nearly 4 years into this now. Is it really a problem if someone picks something again?
[2/9/24, 2:54:28 PM] Rory Edwards: It was allowed at the start of club I think.
[2/9/24, 2:55:15 PM] Neil Tilston: Ok so it's always been allowed just never happened before

[2/9/24, 3:15:33 PM] Neil Tilston: So for example Grant and I agree a lot of the time about our taste in Hip Hop. But he rates Eminem a lot higher than I do. I'm not hating on Em but he'd be nowhere near my top 10  MCs. However I'm aware for many people he's top 5 or number one.

He played a track off this recently called "Bad Meets Evil" resting Royce Da 5'9 which was pretty cool so I had been planning to revisit...
[2/9/24, 3:17:33 PM] Neil Tilston: *featuring (not resting)
[2/9/24, 3:18:21 PM] Rory Edwards: Either is fine. There is lots of stuff that I have never properly given a go to that people rave about.
[2/9/24, 3:19:54 PM] Neil Tilston: I think Em is similar in many ways to things I've said recently about both Arctic Monkeys and Taylor. I don't hate it in fact I think they're all pretty good I just always felt I heard enough of it out and about in the world that I rarely felt the need to actively listen to it for myself.
[2/9/24, 3:20:50 PM] Neil Tilston: But in all cases it's possible that I've not given enough time and attention to fully appreciate and enjoy them.
[2/9/24, 3:32:35 PM] David Thomas: Do we have to be nice about it?
[2/9/24, 3:33:06 PM] Fergus Neville: Don’t pick something intentionally shite please!
[2/9/24, 3:33:39 PM] David Thomas: I picked already, but in the spirit of the theme I’m wondering if I have to give it a positive review
[2/9/24, 3:34:12 PM] David Thomas: I guess that’s in the👂 of the beholder
[2/9/24, 3:35:26 PM] Neil Tilston: I guess the spirit is to give it "a chance"
[2/9/24, 3:35:40 PM] Neil Tilston: But self pan definitely possible

[2/10/24, 9:41:15 AM] Rory Edwards: That's the idea. I do think we come to albums with a lot of preconceptions which means we listen through a negative lens. Some albums I don't get till the tenth listen but I might have got them much earlier if I could have got round what I believed they sounded like going in.

[2/15/24, 3:26:11 AM] Rory Edwards: I can catch up on that last album.
[2/15/24, 3:27:00 AM] Rory Edwards: I'm off tomorrow, classic mistake.
[2/15/24, 3:27:44 AM] Neil Tilston: Me too! Flight at 6am 😳 tomorrow to Paris! 🇫🇷🗼🥖
[2/15/24, 3:29:56 AM] Rory Edwards: *Insert terrible joke I can't quite think of about it being on the ground in the right place here*
[2/16/24, 1:31:42 AM] Neil Tilston: I really think this is cool . I quite liked the first album but didn't think it was different enough from Radiohead to really justify the need for the project. I feel this time they're more clearly playing around with time signatures and being a bit more jazzy in general. The second half of the album in particular I find really cool and interesting. Definitely one I'll be listening to more!
[2/16/24, 1:34:08 AM] Neil Tilston: Inevitably (given the theme) I'm a bit less enthused with my own pick. I admire Eminem's talent his flow is great, he's a good storyteller and is often very funny. But a whole album is still a bit too much fore in one sitting. The humour is fairly juvenile which is fine a bit much for an hour. Dre's production is fine but imo a little overrated.
[2/16/24, 1:36:15 AM] Neil Tilston: I love Mogwai and this was the first "new album" of theirs I got to experience. I think it's slightly more accessible than some of their records but no less emotional. If you're still unconvinced by mogwai @⁨Rory Edwards⁩ then I'd strongly recommend seeing them live. Maybe at the big city festival in Glasgow!?
[2/16/24, 1:37:49 AM] Neil Tilston: Actually really enjoyed this. Pavement a band I've never really got into either. I knew the track Cut your hair already but the rest was new to me. I guess they took that early REM sound and made it a bit more angular and created a template for future "us college radio rock" for the next decade at least. Was more varied than I expected as well. At points it even reminded me of Mogwai and in others it was a bit jazzy as well. Cool record 👍
[2/16/24, 2:37:26 AM] Rory Edwards: Top reviewing @⁨Neil Tilston⁩.
[2/16/24, 2:37:59 AM] Rory Edwards: I don't enjoy.this as much as their first effort I don't think but it's still deep and rich
[2/16/24, 2:38:08 AM] Fergus Neville: Definitely - I agreed with all of it!
[2/16/24, 2:38:35 AM] Rory Edwards: .I think I can often get a better handle on what Radiohead songs are about.
[2/16/24, 2:38:57 AM] Rory Edwards: It's got a cool atmosphere though and loads to notice. I reckon it will grow.
[2/16/24, 2:39:33 AM] Rory Edwards: Agree with all.lf.tbis exceptnproduction.
[2/16/24, 2:39:50 AM] Rory Edwards: The bit about production*
[2/16/24, 2:40:16 AM] Rory Edwards: I didn't Dre a lot more varied than some other producers but he still manages to hold.tjings together.
[2/16/24, 2:42:03 AM] Rory Edwards: I do think Eminem is an interesting voice. Many have come to think of marginalised people much more in terms of race and gender than class recently.
[2/16/24, 2:42:54 AM] Rory Edwards: I do think white working class voices are often ignored or co-opted by twats which leads to school shootings, trumps and brexits.
[2/16/24, 2:44:26 AM] Rory Edwards: I know Eminem's isn't perfect but he's been on a journey, and I do think he gets dunked on a bit where gangsta stuff about bitches and hoes may well get ignored.
[2/16/24, 2:44:54 AM] Rory Edwards: He might make people uncomfortable as he reveals some of what's worst about them.
[2/16/24, 2:45:24 AM] Rory Edwards: Not saying you did any of this in your review. I don't listen to the bloodhound gang for broadly the same reasons. They also aren't as good.
[2/16/24, 2:55:48 AM] Rory Edwards: I liked Pavement a lot too. Sounded like a bunch of bands I couldn't put my finger on which probably means they've been ripped off to fuck. Creative and varied, quite arty as they mucked around with guitar sounds.
[2/16/24, 2:58:00 AM] Rory Edwards: So I have already seen Mogwai live. I enjoyed them fine but whoever it was I saw them with gave them such a billing (was at least Bob and maybe you too Neil) they had a mountain to climb
[2/16/24, 2:58:20 AM] Rory Edwards: I also knew next to nothing about their music which doesn't help.
[2/16/24, 2:59:05 AM] Rory Edwards: However... I did really enjoy this record. Emotional, deep and varied. So many layers of sound.
[2/16/24, 2:59:27 AM] Rory Edwards: It wasn't just loud which I always tend to think of them as.
[2/16/24, 2:59:56 AM] Rory Edwards: Wasn't quite a Skinny Fists experience but what is. 4.5 stars from me.
[2/16/24, 3:38:31 AM] Fergus Neville: I haven’t got all the way through Eminem yet…got annoyed with it and had to turn off halfway through. Hopefully I’ll enjoy more of a bite-sized portion today.
[2/16/24, 7:45:44 AM] Neil Tilston: Does this still apply?

Bit of a blind spot for me tbh. But I do know and like this album and am fairly sure it fits the bill.
[2/17/24, 2:07:18 PM] Neil Tilston: I suspect this is a bit like asking someone to pick an obscure UK punk album and they pick nevermind the bollocks so apologies if this is a total obvs pick.

I had this on a mixtape years ago but had completely forgotten about it!
[2/20/24, 2:46:45 AM] Neil Tilston: I think in my head I'd merged it with this (slightly) similar cowboy related song that was also on the same mixtape
[2/20/24, 2:47:09 AM] Neil Tilston: https://open.spotify.com/track/3VWNKbj9nNhSvKCiaLzyGv?si=QMc2dJvpR-6-r1DokOukfg
[2/20/24, 6:47:16 AM] Rory Edwards: Not got to cowboys but going to do an early review of this piece because it's awesome. A pocket riot of an album about regret and making the best of it in a place with no prospects.
[2/20/24, 6:47:40 AM] Rory Edwards: It simultaneously manages to be tight as fuck and sound like it has been recorded in a garage that's full of bees and on fire a bit.
[2/20/24, 6:48:18 AM] Rory Edwards: Missed that guitar hook? No worries the next song has three more. The drumming is also absolutely outstanding.
[2/20/24, 6:49:08 AM] Rory Edwards: Had forgotten how good it was. Think there are some interesting Scottish comparisons you can draw - early Idlewild and We Were Promised Jetpacks both share similar DNA imo.
[2/20/24, 6:49:17 AM] Rory Edwards: Spoiler - we didn't get any jetpacks.
[2/20/24, 10:05:32 AM] David Thomas: agree with all of this rory - these guys rule. they're maybe missing that standout lyrical expertise that makes them peers with Idlewild, but much more energetic and like you say tight than most surf-punk/garage punk bands of similar type
[2/20/24, 1:31:11 PM] Neil Tilston: Tbh I thought every song sounded the same
[2/20/24, 1:31:26 PM] Neil Tilston: But that song was fucking great 👍👍
[2/20/24, 1:34:22 PM] Rory Edwards: It does have that about it. Like that Andrew WK album we did. Was there really any reason to put the track breaks in?
[2/20/24, 1:51:56 PM] David Thomas: Would be remiss if I didn’t gloating point out that I’ve picked these guys before, back in year 1 days
[2/20/24, 1:53:18 PM] David Thomas: nailed the theme though, and thoroughly enjoyed
[2/20/24, 1:57:53 PM] David Thomas: I also enjoy listening to this once every 5 or 10years. its oft celebrated as the greatest underground emo album, tbh I never really got into it.  Its majestic and emotional and subtle post-rock, but leaves me with a taste all of the teenage feelings (whiney) parts of emo, without any of the urgency or life that you get out of an alkaline trio album, or the hooks you get in a jimmy eat world album.
[2/20/24, 2:06:47 PM] David Thomas: thought this was great, much enjoyed. the last modest mouse album pick was their recent one, which i think we all agreed was insipid. great to hear this as a throwback to their original sounds -  much more grunge than what i think of them (the much more poppy GoodNews and The Moon era), but still instantly recognizable with not just the voice, but the jangly riffs and heavy on the whammy-bar usage.
[2/20/24, 2:07:26 PM] David Thomas: great stuff - pick of the week for me, redefining midwest emo into actually good, not just 'good for emo'
[2/20/24, 2:10:07 PM] Neil Tilston: *Pacific north-west emo
[2/21/24, 12:16:48 PM] Rory Edwards: Coulda kept it classy, but no 🤣
[2/21/24, 12:17:09 PM] Rory Edwards: Now worried my music taste is effectively Dave's in reverse.
[2/21/24, 12:20:07 PM] Rory Edwards: Very much agree with your review of this Dave. I like it and it has a good sense of melody and musical depth some other emo albums lack. My only issue with it is that it never quite chooses to kick bricks and go full on 'I hate my dad' to the sound of huge powerchords. An introspective, clever listen that doesn't quite hit the heights for me.
[2/21/24, 12:28:12 PM] Fergus Neville: I just finished American Football too. A friend made me listen to it a couple of years back and I didn't think much of it - the record seemed to have finished before I picked out any melodies or lyrics. Definitely got on better with it this time. suspect it will be a grower.
[2/21/24, 3:08:08 PM] David Thomas: They don’t call you bleeding edge Ferg for nothing
[2/21/24, 3:23:24 PM] Fergus Neville: Correct, they call me "Pick of the week Ferg"
[2/21/24, 3:23:45 PM] David Thomas: Could have kept it classy, but no
[2/21/24, 3:24:14 PM] Fergus Neville: Didn't say what I was picking

[2/23/24, 10:08:37 AM] Rory Edwards: Enjoyed both other offer this week  Found Modest Mouse to be a bit like a darker, stripped back Pixies. Certainly fitted the small town despair angle. Cowboy tune the best one.
[2/23/24, 10:11:11 AM] Rory Edwards: Godly the Rule a bit like 100 Gecs made an RnB album so basically.    👍👍🐿️🦄🦨👍👍
[2/23/24, 1:03:42 PM] Neil Tilston: I quite like this but I suspect it's because it sounds quite post rock and less winey I hate my dad emo and so is more to my taste.
[2/23/24, 1:04:25 PM] Neil Tilston: This was very cool.  I'd never heard the whole thing before and it's now my favourite modest mouse album. Very angular angsty and interesting 👍👍
[2/23/24, 1:04:59 PM] Neil Tilston: This sounds like you got AI to try and make the most Stems record ever. Enjoyed it 👍
[2/23/24, 1:05:12 PM] Neil Tilston: Are we doing singles today @⁨David Thomas⁩ ?
[2/23/24, 1:13:47 PM] David Thomas: Aye, go for it: free choice or Midwest singles
[2/23/24, 1:15:13 PM] David Thomas: Was expecting someone to pick the Replacements for a Midwest album, so here’s a related banger:
[2/23/24, 1:15:20 PM] Neil Tilston: Detroit is mid west right? And I can pick hip hop right?

I didn't love the Eminem album I picked the other week. But I mainly picked for the track he did with Royce Da 5 9 . He has some total bangers ...

[2/23/24, 4:12:26 PM] Fergus Neville: Mind that theme I did a few years back where I pick an album and then you need to pick something linked to it in some way, but you can’t use the same link twice? Everyone hated it.

[2/26/24, 8:50:01 AM] Neil Tilston: I've listened to this 4 times now and I still suspect I'll need more to fully from an opinion. At times it's very beautiful. At other times I definitely end up zoning out and losing focus and it very much fades into the background. At it's best it's haunting and melodic like doves meets the Beatles. At other times is it a bit elbow b sides? Or will the whole thing win me over if I keep listening? It might be my album of the year?
[2/26/24, 8:52:46 AM] Rory Edwards: How was Saturday gents,  loving the pics as ever. Shame I couldn't be there
[2/26/24, 9:01:15 AM] Neil Tilston: It was epic. Think your parents are amongst our most regular patrons now!

[2/28/24, 11:31:19 AM] David Thomas: I like this a lot, but I think Neil's review influenced me a bit - totally agree that its mixed. Good when its joyful and lively, almost disco, less good, or at least less-aligned with the rest when its melencholic, at its best when its a combination of two - jaunty tune with brutal lyrics/theme (eg "This Cant go on").  Love the piano and the strings, and the album title in welsh combined with that album cover make me want to root for him.
[2/28/24, 11:31:30 AM] David Thomas: did everyone else know he used to be in the coral?
[2/28/24, 11:33:15 AM] David Thomas: this was great. love his take on the themes above - sadness and joy all mixed up and getting weird together
[2/28/24, 11:35:12 AM] David Thomas: lovely music, and his voice gets better and better with time, draws you right in. love the country lilt of the first track, and how it spreads open wide to the rest of the tracks, which are lets face it all over the place musically - reminds me of later day belle and sebastian in that respect
[2/28/24, 11:37:53 AM] David Thomas: struggled a bit with Radiator, especially after the lushness of the Gruff record, it sounds s bit disjointed and 'noisy' - the melodies are really hidden behind the noise. suspect i would have loved hearing it again on a different day though.

[3/1/24, 1:54:46 AM] Neil Tilston: Think their PR team deserves some credit as well.
[3/1/24, 2:35:46 AM] Fergus Neville: The Times highlighting class struggle is a new one on me
[3/1/24, 2:48:27 AM] Neil Tilston: How does the singles theme work today?
[3/1/24, 2:48:47 AM] Neil Tilston: Does someone pick a single linked to Dave's album and we go from there?
[3/1/24, 2:48:58 AM] Neil Tilston: Do you start us off again?
[3/1/24, 3:03:31 AM] Fergus Neville: I’ll start us off, but I’ll wake until sleepy Dave is up
[3/1/24, 4:18:13 AM] Rory Edwards: She's not wrong. But just how do these beautiful people from fantastically rich families become successful? Truly the great mystery of our times.
[3/1/24, 4:23:53 AM] Rory Edwards: Agree with this review. I remember it being my favourite SFA album but the production does sound a bit rough, it might not be anymore. Still I love the concept, dealing with your Demons joyfully in plain site and there are bangers on there too.
[3/1/24, 4:25:27 AM] Rory Edwards: This is very, very good. Melancholy without being a mood killer. I agree with others it can fade into the background but I quite like that ebb and flow, makes the high points land all the harder.
[3/1/24, 4:26:42 AM] Rory Edwards: Also liked this a lot, loved how jazzy it was.
[3/1/24, 4:28:56 AM] Rory Edwards: There seem to be a lot of these neighbourhoody garage rock albums which is just fine in my book as I tend to enjoy them. 181935 my highlight on this.
[3/1/24, 4:38:15 AM] Neil Tilston: I enjoyed radiator I thought it was nice hearing two extremes of Gryff's range side by side. Young and angry Vs wiser and reflective.
[3/1/24, 4:38:49 AM] Neil Tilston: Did anyone else get serious "clap your hands say yeah" vibes from the vocals on this?
[3/1/24, 4:39:28 AM] Neil Tilston: Liked this and thought it would have fit well on previous week theme also

[3/1/24, 8:28:24 AM] David Thomas: Can’t wait to hear what Rory picks - cos I got nothing after that. We can’t use weather as a theme again right?
[3/1/24, 8:28:39 AM] Fergus Neville: Correct

[3/1/24, 8:42:14 AM] Neil Tilston: Are you confusing Randolph with Rudolph?

[3/6/24, 10:03:51 AM] Rory Edwards: @⁨Neil Tilston⁩ Neil will your set be online anytime? Kids bedtime disrupted play.

[3/6/24, 10:04:59 AM] Neil Tilston: Shabka Hutchings does bluegrass!
[3/6/24, 10:05:05 AM] Neil Tilston: Aye sometime
[3/6/24, 10:05:13 AM] Neil Tilston: Will let you know when it's available
[3/6/24, 10:07:41 AM] Rory Edwards: Have decided this is also class. Production so on point. Pulls no punches re. the realities of being born poor and black but understands rather than glorifies or judges.
[3/6/24, 10:11:04 AM] Neil Tilston: I think That's particularly true of No Malice's verses. Pusha is definitely guilty of glorifying the business of dealing drugs at times. But he's very good at it! Neptune's production on this is next level they were absolutely on top of this game at this stage.
[3/6/24, 10:15:18 AM] Neil Tilston: I actually referred to this clipse album a while back when discussing the most recent Pusha T solo album
[3/6/24, 11:25:44 AM] David Thomas: there is a LOT of kora on this album
[3/6/24, 11:26:20 AM] David Thomas: I found the kora pleasant enough for the first half, but after about 20mins i had reached my limit of kora
[3/6/24, 11:32:12 AM] Neil Tilston: Agree with David here
[3/6/24, 11:39:57 AM] Fergus Neville: There's an interesting story for this album which I probably should have shared beforehand
[3/6/24, 11:40:25 AM] Fergus Neville: It was made entirely on the laptop of a Japanese kid who had never heard a kora before
[3/6/24, 11:40:53 AM] Neil Tilston: Dingies
[3/6/24, 11:41:02 AM] Fergus Neville: Correct
[3/6/24, 11:41:08 AM] David Thomas: it was not
[3/6/24, 11:41:28 AM] Fergus Neville: It does have a good story though - there was a feature in this month's Uncut. Will share it after work duties.

[3/6/24, 1:06:53 PM] David Thomas: Definitely glorifies the bidness, might be that I’m too naïve to get all the references, but he makes it sound super fun
[3/6/24, 1:07:27 PM] David Thomas: “I’ll turn your Cookie Monster blue” - is this a drug thing, or a sex thing? Either way count me in!
[3/6/24, 1:07:55 PM] David Thomas: Love the silliness of the hook- lots of ‘brab bran’ and ‘wamp wamp’
[3/6/24, 1:08:46 PM] David Thomas: Dirty money 💰 a great example - trashy lyrics about a hip hop trope, but just kind of lighthearted?
[3/6/24, 6:26:18 PM] Neil Tilston: Sunday show now available to listen back https://www.mixcloud.com/jamradio/funky-gunners-030324/
[3/7/24, 3:57:48 PM] Rory Edwards: This was interesting to have as something different but didn't really float my boat unfortunately. Maybe they should hang out with Andre.
[3/7/24, 3:58:11 PM] Rory Edwards: Pleasant enough just got a bit much.
[3/7/24, 3:59:02 PM] Rory Edwards: I liked Korean Hip Hop. It comes across as parody in places but is very entertaining. Very varied production too.
[3/7/24, 4:17:50 PM] Rory Edwards: Funk Gunners got me through the dishes too. Getting into the swing of the kit by the sound of things.

[3/8/24, 11:29:03 AM] Rory Edwards: New theme?
[3/8/24, 11:44:29 AM] Neil Tilston: Aye
[3/8/24, 11:45:08 AM] David Thomas: Aye
[3/8/24, 11:45:27 AM] Rory Edwards: Speaking of crimes, we've had a lot of.politicking this week which has served to remind me how bloody awful all four plausible candidates for the leadership of our respective countries are. About the best you can hope for is a good laugh at how terribly they come across and the election of someone who isn't an outright fascist. So let's listen to music instead.

[3/8/24, 3:03:20 PM] Rory Edwards: I should say please don't take me too seriously, I don't mean to project my politics onto you guys. Just hacked off at the state of some things and too tired to riot properly so tunes is my next best thing.

[3/9/24, 5:23:27 AM] Fergus Neville: That is superb! The Republican response video was totally unhinged.
[3/10/24, 6:23:48 AM] Neil Tilston: Great band with very distinctive sound. I know the two more recent albums (Shook and There is no year). First time listening to this it has that signature intensity and driving bass.

Reminds me slightly of TV on the radio and particularly Zeal & Ardor.
[3/10/24, 6:28:48 AM] Neil Tilston: Title track is pure soul ❤️
[3/11/24, 3:58:36 AM] Neil Tilston: You joining in this week @⁨Fergus Neville⁩ ?
[3/11/24, 4:16:50 AM] Fergus Neville: Listening to a few possibilities. Almost picked Dylan on Friday, but could hear Dave whining “Why don’t you just pick Bob fucking Dylan for protest week Ferg?!”. May yet go there.
[3/11/24, 4:18:19 AM] Neil Tilston: The pre pan fear is real
[3/11/24, 4:18:43 AM] Rory Edwards: Pick Taylor Swift.
[3/11/24, 6:44:03 AM] Fergus Neville: A Dylan connection, but hopefully something which is new to you
[3/11/24, 6:44:13 AM] Fergus Neville: https://open.spotify.com/album/5z56SO1GMxmXbNIRBbOBcj?si=ELh6Hmx6TCKbNfpXI-D2CA
[3/11/24, 6:55:13 AM] Rory Edwards: Taylor Swift special edition driven vinyl inflation! Time to take to the streets. First they came for the Artic Monkeys fans etc. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-68515100
[3/11/24, 6:57:30 AM] Rory Edwards: So I love this record but haven't listened to any of their others - what's the next one to try? Agree they sound really distinctive, hard to pin down genre wise. Will do my review once I've had a chance to listen this week.
[3/11/24, 5:11:54 PM] David Thomas: Ferg did you ever share this interesting story?
[3/11/24, 6:38:35 PM] Neil Tilston: The newest one - Shook has lots of great guests

[3/15/24, 3:42:38 AM] Rory Edwards: Protest bangers today. Sorry been a bit silent on the chats due to work madness but enjoyed all four and going to post some thoughts later.
[3/15/24, 3:44:15 AM] Neil Tilston: https://open.spotify.com/track/2itPegdGAksguJItwZyOK1?si=sDuTmMmES9ekKOz2VphTDw
[3/15/24, 3:54:12 AM] Neil Tilston: I actually prefer this to takes a nation of millions. The music is a little less harsh and more soulful with no compromise on the lyrics. A direct hit on white supremecy
[3/15/24, 3:55:16 AM] Neil Tilston: 911 is a joke, welcome to the terror dome, anti-ni*** machine and fight the power all easily in my top 10 PE tracks
[3/15/24, 3:56:12 AM] Neil Tilston: Is it deliberately ironic to make a mediocre pink album in protest of punk becoming mediocre?
[3/15/24, 3:56:21 AM] Neil Tilston: *punk
[3/15/24, 3:56:43 AM] Neil Tilston: I thought the first track was ace but the rest was a bit mediocre
[3/15/24, 3:57:41 AM] Neil Tilston: Never heard this before (except maybe two songs on the soundtrack album?). Really enjoyed the set. Recording is great - feel like you're there.
[3/15/24, 3:59:56 AM] Neil Tilston: Fuck government organisations that deliberately flood poor neighbourhoods with drugs. Then demonise those living there as criminals because those drugs become the defacto currency while simultaneously destroying the communities.
[3/15/24, 4:00:45 AM] Neil Tilston: The track felt a good follow up to foabp

[3/15/24, 4:06:15 AM] Fergus Neville: Ol’ Bob deserves at least a single in this theme, and this is a fabulous protest banger
[3/15/24, 4:08:32 AM] Neil Tilston: Great shout. Led to a really interesting discussion at record night one time.
[3/15/24, 4:08:52 AM] Neil Tilston: I wouldn't play it as a DJ but would play it at home.
[3/15/24, 4:13:48 AM] Neil Tilston: Scarlet Rivera's violin is incredible on this. Wish he'd made more music with the band he put together for Desire ♥️
‎[3/15/24, 4:14:11 AM] Neil Tilston: ‎image omitted
[3/15/24, 4:16:40 AM] Neil Tilston: One of Dylan's best vocal performances?
[3/15/24, 4:27:59 AM] Fergus Neville: 👍👍
[3/15/24, 4:34:12 AM] Rory Edwards: 👍
[3/15/24, 7:27:54 AM] Rory Edwards: So one of the thing I really like about this record (band probably although I haven't listened further yet) is that it asks questions about what traditionally black protest music is in a post/neo colonial world.
[3/15/24, 7:29:10 AM] Rory Edwards: The answer seems to be gospel and soul vocals set against the grinding darkness, more akin to Xterminator or the Intense Humming of Evil than an organ.
[3/15/24, 7:29:34 AM] Rory Edwards: This is a very good thing imo.
[3/15/24, 7:30:48 AM] Rory Edwards: It lacks coherence in places and a few of the tunes don't really resolve which stops it from being an all time classic but I still think it's great.
[3/15/24, 7:31:08 AM] Rory Edwards: Maybe the unresolved part is an artistic choice - The Battle of the Algiers is Over/Not Over.
[3/15/24, 7:33:06 AM] Rory Edwards: Was interesting to listen to set against Joan's solidarity laden renditions of gospel classics. Great artist. Great set. Soaring voice, still awesome now.
[3/15/24, 7:35:32 AM] Rory Edwards: I liked this. Full of power and drive. Wonderfully blunt in places - like when it talks about how they don't understand how exploitative manager's don't just kill themselves. I took the stuff about drugs and medicore bands to be self awareness.  Maybe is aye...
[3/15/24, 7:39:55 AM] Rory Edwards: Agree this is an amazing record. For me very much about identity and the meaning of allyship. You fear us because we're coming to eat your lunch and it's actually a good thing. No punches pulled. Great groove. A little too long.
[3/15/24, 8:07:57 AM] Rory Edwards: Forgot a banger https://open.spotify.com/track/4BP3uh0hFLFRb5cjsgLqDh?si=bOlSx9E6Rb-QGVf_X3WE6w

[3/15/24, 10:45:42 AM] David Thomas: Definitely not mediocore
[3/15/24, 11:37:46 AM] Neil Tilston: Next on the themes?
[3/15/24, 11:38:17 AM] Neil Tilston: I'm leaving for the airport in an hour. If I can get some albums downloaded before I leave that'll help me get ahead on listening 👍
[3/15/24, 11:53:14 AM] Neil Tilston: I think it's @⁨David Thomas⁩ 's turn?
[3/15/24, 11:53:30 AM] Neil Tilston: If you're not still in the huff about my lukewarm response to NOFX
[3/15/24, 11:58:17 AM] David Thomas: Yes, still in a huff, but not so much that it won’t stop me picking something terrible
[3/15/24, 11:58:58 AM] Fergus Neville: You'll notice that i've not panned it Dave
[3/15/24, 12:00:26 PM] David Thomas: After all the “I’m sad my husband is in jail” intensity of last week, let’s have some inconsequential albums. Give me the most trivial, low iq album that is just great for embracing its frivolousness

The funky n beats comps are always great party records. Pretty sure I picked X ray Ted's edition before. Here's the most recent one from Boca 45. It will be an absolute jam of a party record.

[3/15/24, 4:56:59 PM] Rory Edwards: At an Amdram Dolly Parton thing my sister is in and bizarrely both of Dave Mitchell's sisters too.
[3/15/24, 4:57:09 PM] Rory Edwards: It is very entertaining in the way these things are.
[3/15/24, 4:57:10 PM] Rory Edwards: And his mum too apparently?!

[3/15/24, 6:36:21 PM] Rory Edwards: I think they should put you back up there to explain this debacle.

[3/16/24, 5:31:42 AM] Rory Edwards: I have racked my game about this then remembered that someone once made a Big Beat album in tribute to a video game about graffiti on the original Xbox.

[3/18/24, 12:56:59 PM] Rory Edwards: Turns out my misremembered not really a big beat album kinda bangs. Not that you would expect anything else from one of my random picks obvs.
[3/18/24, 12:57:32 PM] Rory Edwards: A bit early Prodigy in places, a bit Beastie Boys in others, some classic lofi hip hop mixed in. What's not to like.
[3/18/24, 12:57:59 PM] Rory Edwards: Not really coherent enough to be it's own thing but also has a track called Tag Walls, Punch Fascists so all is forgiven.
[3/18/24, 12:58:10 PM] Rory Edwards: 7/10
[3/18/24, 12:59:02 PM] Rory Edwards: Btw this was the video game that inspired it. I was never patient enough to actually finish the game but presumably all the themes line up https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Set_Radio_Future
[3/18/24, 1:47:34 PM] Neil Tilston: Dave - pick something that's the opposite of protest music
Rory - picks album where favourite song title includes "punch fascists"
👌😂👍
[3/18/24, 2:34:06 PM] David Thomas: nah this rules.
[3/18/24, 2:34:33 PM] David Thomas: What are you playing these days Rory? (Between games - Looking for recs)
[3/18/24, 2:44:53 PM] Neil Tilston: Oh it absolutely does !
[3/18/24, 2:55:23 PM] Rory Edwards: To be honest mate I only buy games I don't actually play them. It really depends what you're looking for but on the Indie side I would recommend Undertale (wistful RPG and bullet hell shooter) and Shovel Knight (platformer).
[3/18/24, 2:56:45 PM] Rory Edwards: For biggest budget stuff I really liked Nier:Automata (Beat em up RPG). The new Final Fantasy remake is also really good. Elden Ring is incredible but so huge and tough I never finished it.
[3/18/24, 4:50:12 PM] Rory Edwards: Oh actually one game that I would massively recommend for anyone is Disco Elysium - it's a point and click adventure about an alcoholic detective. It's beyond awesome. Soundtrack by Sea Power.
[3/18/24, 4:51:01 PM] Rory Edwards: Took me about an hour to find my other shoe but then it opened up from there.
[3/18/24, 4:52:35 PM] David Thomas: Honestly this question was me hoping you’d say Elden ring so I could justify spending $90 or whatever it costs. Currently playing through ‘Hogw*arts L*gacy’ with the kids, so need something else
[3/18/24, 4:53:33 PM] David Thomas: This sounds ace though. British Sea Power? Is this the same band?
[3/18/24, 4:55:00 PM] Rory Edwards: It is brilliant. The gameplay is awesome and the scope.is incredible but the thing is I can never get a decent enough run at playing it to get good enough to finish. I beat the first two  Dark Souls but I had more time then. You will have fun regardless tho. Worth the money.
[3/18/24, 4:55:20 PM] Rory Edwards: Yeah they dropped the British.

[3/19/24, 1:52:27 PM] Rory Edwards: Favourite tune probably Hardcore Poetry.

[3/21/24, 12:30:54 PM] Neil Tilston: The harmonica not the cucumber
[3/21/24, 12:49:07 PM] Neil Tilston: Interestingly enough going to see that very same band this Saturday! No idea if Eddie's going...
[3/21/24, 1:41:09 PM] Neil Tilston: Good listening this week
[3/21/24, 1:41:55 PM] Neil Tilston: This was great quirky fun. Brand new to me. Goofy fun and chilled 👍👍
[3/21/24, 1:42:50 PM] Neil Tilston: Actually found this a bit weaker than some of the other funk n beats comps. But the standard is high so still good fun. Just only 5-6 real standout moments though. Some of the others are honestly even better.
[3/21/24, 1:43:16 PM] Neil Tilston: This was total class and brand new to me. Really enjoyed it and will listen again.
[3/21/24, 1:43:58 PM] Neil Tilston: Tried to listen to this at work but was quite distracting and seemed a bit mediocre...
[3/21/24, 1:44:17 PM] Neil Tilston: But then I put it on while driving and loved it!

[3/21/24, 5:27:21 PM] Rory Edwards: Also very much enjoyed this week.
[3/21/24, 5:28:23 PM] Rory Edwards: This was silly but also engaging. What I expected from this theme.
[3/21/24, 5:29:07 PM] Rory Edwards: Glad they are still funding bluesy bands like this. There might be a couple every generation that are worth listening to but they're good fun.
[3/21/24, 5:31:00 PM] Rory Edwards: I think Jamie actually got me into the OST for Jersey Radio Future back in the day. That is what I remember as Big Beat but listening back now it is actually more Rave.
[3/21/24, 5:31:32 PM] Rory Edwards: It also bangs btw.
[3/21/24, 5:31:46 PM] Rory Edwards: I can't remember where I heard about this album itself but listened as a curiosity and did not regret.
[3/21/24, 7:54:45 PM] Neil Tilston: Definitely a bit big beat on some tracks
[3/22/24, 4:07:31 AM] Neil Tilston: Inconsequential bangers?

[3/22/24, 1:03:02 PM] David Thomas: Can I recommend the Chapel Roan tiny desk concert as an appetizer? I think Brian would especially enjoy this

[3/26/24, 8:04:44 PM] David Thomas: Sorry! I’m out in Missouri interviewing again this week, two days this time, and it’s the kids half term, so we’re all here and are going to look at some houses tomorrow (still very speculative at the moment)
[3/26/24, 8:05:28 PM] David Thomas: I’m gonna need some time to think on Neil young theme I’m afraid, not familiar with his game ‎<This message was edited>

[3/27/24, 3:42:55 AM] Rory Edwards: Can I just say for someone that gets held up as such a legend by some Neil Young has pretty much passed me by.
[3/27/24, 3:43:05 AM] Rory Edwards: See also Eric Clapton.
[3/27/24, 3:44:04 AM] Fergus Neville: Good theme then! Well done to all involved.
[3/28/24, 12:48:42 PM] Neil Tilston: Dave it's Thursday dude.

Hope interviews etc all going well.

Can we have an album when you get a sec (Buffalo Springfield albums are worth checking out if you're still stuck)
[3/28/24, 12:50:45 PM] Rory Edwards: I enjoyed this a lot, Bluesy almost Beatles in places vibe. Interesting stuff about generations repeating themselves and our capacity to change or cause that.
[3/28/24, 12:52:14 PM] Rory Edwards: I wasn't so keen on this. Just a bit melancholy which you may expect for an album all about aftermaths. Best when the tempo was higher and the blues guitar was out, which is what I understood Neil Young to be about. Still very well crafted if not always my cup of tea. Vocal very distinctive.
[3/28/24, 12:53:06 PM] Rory Edwards: Going to put Harvest on tonight once the kids are down then play video games till my eyes bleed (Marie is out).
[3/28/24, 12:53:11 PM] Neil Tilston: The earlier solo album is more guitar based but noone picked that... Yet
[3/28/24, 12:54:27 PM] Neil Tilston: I actually don't really enjoy Neil Young that much and when I do a little goes a long way. I find his solo albums all to be a bit of a slog. The winey voice just grates too much after 15 mins or so. I think that's why I like him best in a band with other voices as well.
[3/28/24, 12:55:06 PM] Neil Tilston: I mean he's good like I'm not panning at all. I just prefer CSNY and buffalo Springfield to his solo stuff.
[3/28/24, 12:55:17 PM] Neil Tilston: Although will happily listen to individual tracks
[3/28/24, 12:56:13 PM] Neil Tilston: I might pick a tune from BS or the earlier more guitary solo stuff of the theme survives for singles club tomorrow
[3/28/24, 12:56:19 PM] Neil Tilston: *if
[3/28/24, 12:57:10 PM] Rory Edwards: The blessing and curse of all 'distinctive' vocals imo is that the create distinctions. I'm sure you'll find someone who says his falsetto style stuff is fantastic but I more tend to agree with you.
[3/28/24, 12:57:46 PM] Rory Edwards: I'll never get on with The Shins for the same reason, lots of other people who like stuff I like seem to love them.
[3/28/24, 12:58:11 PM] Rory Edwards: Lots of people think Dylan's vocal sucks and it certainly isn't technical but it suits him imo.
[3/28/24, 12:58:22 PM] Neil Tilston: Oh of course it'd be boring if we all liked the same thing. There's dozens of artists I love that I know the voice is an acquired taste. It's just that I've acquired those more than I have Neil's.
[3/28/24, 12:59:06 PM] Neil Tilston: Tom Waits
Bob Dylan
Kathryn Joseph
Mark Lannegan
Iggy Pop
 All fit in the taste I've acquired camp
[3/28/24, 12:59:42 PM] Neil Tilston: Along with Neil Young in the I know it's good but I can only handle it so long I'd put bands like the walkmen and clap your hands say yeah
[3/29/24, 3:59:53 AM] Fergus Neville: I’ll write more on Neil Young and why you’re both wrong later
[3/29/24, 4:00:15 AM] Fergus Neville: For now, singles are free choice, but feel free to pick Buffalo S etc if you’d like.

[3/30/24, 7:13:28 AM] Rory Edwards: Now enjoying this as well. Old school Indie cool.

[3/30/24, 8:46:13 AM] Rory Edwards: Ok so there is a reason, apparently her and Ike got together in St Luis Missouri. I knew I had a reason for thinking she was from there.

[3/31/24, 4:11:07 PM] Neil Tilston: Either a title that mentions drums or an album that features epic drumming. Whatever you want

Brian ended tonight's radio show with something from this. He's been playing it a bit on Tuesday nights and it's a very cool record.
[3/31/24, 4:12:06 PM] Neil Tilston: I know Andre 3000 is a fan as well
[3/31/24, 4:13:25 PM] Neil Tilston: "They alienate-us cause we different keep your hands to the sky
Like Sounds of Blackness when I practice what I preach ain't no lie
I'll be the baker and the maker of the piece of my pie
Now breaker, breaker 10-4 can I get some reply?" From ATLiens
[3/31/24, 4:14:21 PM] Neil Tilston: ‎Neil Tilston changed the group name to “Album Club”
[3/31/24, 5:05:13 PM] Rory Edwards: Have been terrible at Sabbath today but at least I'm getting in with my pick.
[3/31/24, 5:05:58 PM] David Thomas: Just listened back to this - you guys were excellent, top notch stuff
[3/31/24, 5:06:29 PM] Rory Edwards: Have an old low-fi Indie double album that will be too long for probably everyone but is the best 'drums are a real instrument' record I know.
[3/31/24, 5:06:56 PM] Rory Edwards: Give this album a listen: Double Nickels on the Dime

[4/1/24, 8:39:08 AM] Neil Tilston: This is cool...
But why is it so long?
[4/1/24, 10:06:51 AM] Fergus Neville: I enjoyed this, but it lacks the wit and irony of this

[4/1/24, 10:26:58 AM] Fergus Neville: I remember when you were in love with Tesco Alison
[4/1/24, 10:29:53 AM] Rory Edwards: Dunno, it's all cold war anxiety so worried they wouldn't get to make another before being blown up?
[4/1/24, 10:30:15 AM] Rory Edwards: Double albums are a weird thing. They should usually be two albums imo.
[4/1/24, 10:30:16 AM] David Thomas: 'girl in supermarket' also a fertile subject for songs i imagine
[4/1/24, 10:31:01 AM] Fergus Neville: Definitely a good single theme of being in love with girls from various obscrure locations
[4/1/24, 10:31:47 AM] David Thomas: was hoping you'd keep the record store girl theme going tbh
[4/1/24, 10:32:11 AM] Neil Tilston: Speaking of themes we do have one this week and it's got nothing to do with being creepy about girls who work in shops!
[4/1/24, 10:33:04 AM] Fergus Neville: I had one about a girl who worked in a drum shop but nevermind
[4/1/24, 10:33:12 AM] David Thomas: you did not

[4/1/24, 11:00:59 AM] Rory Edwards: Belle and Sebastien would still be a decent theme tbf.
[4/1/24, 11:42:38 AM] Fergus Neville: Just checked if we'd had Led Zep IV and obviously we have. Would have picked it just for the drumming on When the Levee Breaks. Thunderous!

[4/1/24, 3:10:13 PM] David Thomas: this is very cool - my unexpected favorite so far this week, a great smooth drummy alternative to the spikeyness of mine and rory's picks
[4/1/24, 3:19:45 PM] David Thomas: I bet chance is a fan of this too
[4/2/24, 6:43:24 AM] Neil Tilston: Now that's a punk album. In and out now fucking about. Even found time to go a bit goth on the last track 👍👍

[4/2/24, 11:48:35 AM] Fergus Neville: This isn't necessarily an easy listen, but there are some great rhythms and rhymes, and without the Last Poets there wouldn't be hip-hop
[4/2/24, 3:51:28 PM] Rory Edwards: Please tell me this is week before next Newport? Magnetic Fields play 69 Love Songs. https://www.eif.co.uk/events/the-magnetic-fields-part-1
[4/2/24, 3:51:56 PM] Fergus Neville: It is!
[4/2/24, 3:52:00 PM] Fergus Neville: We're the 31st x
[4/2/24, 3:52:13 PM] Rory Edwards: Ok we're booking the above
[4/2/24, 3:52:50 PM] Rory Edwards: All welcome obvs. If out house has finished being a building site you can even stay.
[4/2/24, 3:53:53 PM] Rory Edwards: Let us know and we can try get seats together. Would have to be a quick decision though as getting pretty full already.
[4/2/24, 3:55:45 PM] David Thomas: Nice, they’re playing Boulder in October too - 69songs over 2nights here, so have redo the bracket to figure out which night to go
[4/2/24, 4:02:52 PM] Neil Tilston: Can't confirm 100% but go for it as probably fine and worst case scenario I have to flog the tickets (won't be hard)
[4/2/24, 4:03:07 PM] Neil Tilston: Down for 2 tix
[4/2/24, 4:05:53 PM] Fergus Neville: We're in for 2 two please!
[4/2/24, 4:07:42 PM] Fergus Neville: Same deal here by the looks of things. If the don't play Busby Berkley Dreams then Dee will have an almighty tantrum
[4/2/24, 4:29:10 PM] Rory Edwards: So interestingly this seems to be a two part gig. Half the album Saturday, half Sunday.
[4/2/24, 4:29:18 PM] Rory Edwards: Which half is the one about a dog on?
[4/2/24, 4:30:25 PM] Rory Edwards: Not sure if that changes anything, but let me know if so.
[4/2/24, 4:45:35 PM] Neil Tilston: What if they play every second track
‎[4/2/24, 4:47:05 PM] Rory Edwards: ‎GIF omitted
[4/2/24, 4:57:35 PM] Rory Edwards: To be honest I doubt folk are heading through here for night 2 on a Sunday anyway so that kind of makes up our mind.

[4/2/24, 6:15:08 PM] Neil Tilston: I've had a few pints and might need to clarify what I meant by this
[4/3/24, 2:51:09 AM] Rory Edwards: So screw up this end unfortunately. Apparently we have a 40th birthday that night that hadn't made it to the calendar. It was in my Google calendar as we had an email about it - so thanks AI 😐
[4/3/24, 2:53:15 AM] Rory Edwards: We might go on the Sunday but will need to rally babysitters. Suggest you guys book the Sat and have fun.
[4/3/24, 2:54:33 AM] Rory Edwards: Not having much luck with dates right now, basically everything I have on in the back half of the year so far falls on the same two weekends and in August.
[4/3/24, 2:54:42 AM] Rory Edwards: And there's Newport too now obvs so that's good.
[4/3/24, 3:32:11 AM] Fergus Neville: That’s a pity, sorry to hear that Rory
[4/3/24, 3:32:35 AM] Fergus Neville: Glad you’re available for Randolph’s Leap though which will be a belter
[4/3/24, 3:38:27 AM] Fergus Neville: That’s good because there were either restricted view or £49 tickets so we went for the latter. Bought 2 for you and Aine.
[4/3/24, 4:04:07 AM] Neil Tilston: Nice one thanks bud 👍
[4/3/24, 4:05:00 AM] Neil Tilston: Anyone remember the last poets featuring on a previous album club pick?

Two of the greatest drummers ever face off on this one 🥁🥁
[4/5/24, 5:04:56 AM] Neil Tilston: Already on playlist mate - you picked it already!
[4/5/24, 5:05:15 AM] Rory Edwards: Ah that's good.
[4/5/24, 5:05:20 AM] Rory Edwards: Will have a rethink.
[4/5/24, 5:05:35 AM] Rory Edwards: Enjoyed drumming a lot this week and will post some thoughts later.
[4/5/24, 5:09:09 AM] Rory Edwards: Just thinking this is an option, not sure we've had this band at all before which is probably fair... https://open.spotify.com/track/2jSJm3Gv6GLxduWLenmjKS?si=nJfb58MlQiiGhAs46h_LCw
[4/5/24, 5:11:05 AM] Neil Tilston: deftones are great and you're tight they've somehow never featured before!
[4/5/24, 8:07:48 AM] Fergus Neville: A bit cliched, but someone has to pick this

[4/5/24, 8:41:50 AM] Neil Tilston: Winner
[4/5/24, 1:33:30 PM] Rory Edwards: So challenging maybe but in a good way imo. Still feels as urgent as when it was written. We're very much not the target market though. As bold an attempt to reclaim the Nword as there has ever been.
[4/5/24, 1:35:15 PM] Rory Edwards: Bit of anti-Semitism but it's half a century old and it's not a record about that so I'm ok overlooking it given the context.
[4/5/24, 1:36:02 PM] Rory Edwards: I think this is a great record. Clips along and takes itself just seriously enough.
[4/5/24, 1:36:31 PM] Rory Edwards: Machine Gun Etiquette in particular a belter.
[4/5/24, 1:40:11 PM] Rory Edwards: I enjoyed this a lot, grew on me as it went on which is always a good sign. Preferred the more percussion driven numbers to some of the more soulful stuff which was a bit M People black too so that's fine.
[4/5/24, 1:40:20 PM] Rory Edwards: The Drum my favourite tune from memory.
[4/5/24, 1:44:51 PM] Rory Edwards: I don't find this all that cohesive but I think there is a ton of great music on it. Urgent bursts, sometimes openly political railing against a broken system, sometimes totally wacky, occasionally melancholy.
[4/5/24, 1:48:17 PM] Rory Edwards: Totally reflects the anxiety and urgency of it's time, where from a certain perspective every girl, drink or tune may have been your last. I believe the band name refers to the Doomsday clock, the same thing was used a similar way in Watchmen.
[4/5/24, 1:48:50 PM] Rory Edwards: The drums are so on point as well. Played with huge depth.
[4/5/24, 1:48:52 PM] Rory Edwards: Fin.

[4/6/24, 12:58:49 PM] David Thomas: So ready

[4/8/24, 4:58:02 AM] Neil Tilston: A big influence on Gil Scott Heron and beyond. I've mad respect for this but wouldn't listen to it often to be honest.
[4/8/24, 4:58:49 AM] Neil Tilston: Strong agree - I'd never really explored beyond the debut damned album so this was a pleasant new listen .
[4/8/24, 4:59:49 AM] Neil Tilston: Glad you liked this. There's some elements that have dated a little for sure. But the vision to connect the dots between a huge number of styles of American and African back music makes it a very interesting record imo.
[4/8/24, 5:00:46 AM] Neil Tilston: Agree with your review of this as well. Was a bit much to take in on first listen but maybe one that'll reveal more of it's depth and intrigue with further listening.

[4/9/24, 12:16:06 PM] David Thomas: Incredible levels of vampire-weekendness on display for interviews/reviews of this album:
[4/9/24, 12:17:11 PM] David Thomas: “Koenig … listed “patron saints” for each of the band’s albums — Paul Simon for the self-titled, Joe Strummer and Sublime for Contra, Leonard Cohen for Modern Vampires Of The City, and the Grateful Dead and Phish for Father Of The Bride. For OGWAU, he was even more specific, pointing to the 1997 co-headlining tour by Rage Against The Machine and the Wu-Tang Clan, which reads as semi-jokey shorthand for the ’90s crossover of alt-rock and hip-hop that informs the record’s scruffily metallic, urban/suburban sound.” (NYT article probably paywalled  - https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/20/arts/music/vampire-weekend-only-god-was-above-us.html

[4/9/24, 4:44:00 PM] David Thomas: this is GREAT by the way
[4/9/24, 4:45:00 PM] Neil Tilston: Glad we can agree on that at least. Definitely a step up from David and co 👍

This was my favourite
[4/9/24, 4:47:59 PM] David Thomas: this is likely to get me into strife - but have we had an album of theirs on here before? Not sure what I was expecting, but this took me a bit by suprise, is really varied and lively.
[4/9/24, 4:57:15 PM] Neil Tilston: No but he headlined the first Big Rock show that Fergus and I put on last February so we've discussed him quite a lot.
[4/9/24, 4:58:14 PM] Fergus Neville: He was also in Kid Canaveral who were a St As uni band who you must have seen
[4/9/24, 5:02:15 PM] Neil Tilston: And we're responsible for my best pun of the year so far
[4/9/24, 5:02:20 PM] Neil Tilston: *were
[4/10/24, 12:15:38 PM] Rory Edwards: Agree with the love for this. One of those great records where your favourite track keeps changing to the one you're listening to. Combines wonderfully a lot of Scottish influences.

[4/10/24, 5:07:24 PM] David Thomas: Listening to javelin by Sufjan right now cos works making me a bit sad, but it’s not really screaming in the car music
[4/10/24, 5:08:06 PM] Neil Tilston: AC DC?
[4/10/24, 5:08:09 PM] David Thomas: “WILL ANYONE EVER LOVE ME”
[4/10/24, 5:08:27 PM] David Thomas: Impossible to be sad while listening
[4/10/24, 5:08:47 PM] Neil Tilston: Deftones?
[4/10/24, 5:10:05 PM] David Thomas: Makes me sad
[4/10/24, 5:10:33 PM] Neil Tilston: Do you want the music to be sad or not?
[4/10/24, 5:11:18 PM] Neil Tilston: Mclusky?
[4/10/24, 5:11:46 PM] David Thomas: I think the point is not something that makes you sad, but also not something to cheer you up, just something to be sad to
[4/10/24, 5:12:01 PM] David Thomas: Too fun
[4/10/24, 5:12:11 PM] Neil Tilston: Nirvana?
[4/10/24, 5:12:27 PM] Rory Edwards: Yeah, someone to be sad with, for a while.

[4/11/24, 8:42:26 AM] Fergus Neville: Where are you @⁨Rory Edwards⁩?
[4/11/24, 8:49:30 AM] Rory Edwards: Killin at the moment. Staying on the North side of Loch Tay for a few days. Good being out and about in Scotland again.
[4/11/24, 8:49:51 AM] Neil Tilston: Nice one
[4/11/24, 8:50:14 AM] Fergus Neville: Lovely!
[4/11/24, 11:48:02 AM] Rory Edwards: Sorry not a kid friendly record for those curating small mammals this week but hope you've had a chance to give it a spin. This wouldn't have been my thing at all until recently but I'm coming to appreciate the variety in hip hop more recently.
[4/11/24, 11:48:50 AM] Rory Edwards: Somewhat old school themes combined with some very polished and varied modern production.
[4/11/24, 11:48:59 AM] Rory Edwards: Again takes itself just seriously enough.
[4/11/24, 11:49:20 AM] Rory Edwards: Glad someone is still looking out for those dollars and hoes.
[4/11/24, 11:52:36 AM] Neil Tilston: I liked the production quite a lot but struggle to get on board with him as a rapper. I know I'm behind the curve but I struggle with the flow and rhymes of a lot of the recent "big" names in rap. Trap and those influenced by it have yet to really win me over. There are exceptions but this wasn't really one of them. Could probably get on board for a track or two but a whole album was too much ScHoolboy Q for me.
[4/11/24, 11:54:39 AM] Rory Edwards: I get my silly hat at www.teamvaga.co.uk  I would own more in lots of daft 80s colour combos but I really, really don't need any more hats.
[4/11/24, 11:55:27 AM] Neil Tilston: Despite my pre-pan (I was joking honest @⁨David Thomas⁩) I really enjoyed this. Honestly not a band I listen to a lot but always enjoy when I do. Dynamic and high quality 👌
[4/11/24, 12:01:24 PM] Rory Edwards: Ah shame, I am not on the curve and wasn't aware they were big names particularly. Found it easy to get on with though.
[4/11/24, 12:03:18 PM] Neil Tilston: I just mean there was a time not so long ago where I liked a lot of the "big" names in rap. I'm thinking of the likes of Nas, Em, Jay Z Kanye etc. struggle to get on with the current crop so much (I quite like Kendrick but not as unreservedly as many)
[4/11/24, 12:05:01 PM] Neil Tilston: There are some folk I quite like but they're definitely lower profile (billy woods/sampa the great in particular)
[4/11/24, 12:05:33 PM] Neil Tilston: Most of my favourite recent hip hop is quite nostalgic for the boom bap era
[4/11/24, 12:06:46 PM] Neil Tilston: Black Thought, Joey Badass - 1999 & 2000, Pusha T - Dry, Amerigo Gazaway etc
[4/12/24, 4:22:15 AM] Rory Edwards: Have been a bit distracted but enjoyed all our music this week. Will have to listen back to the moody bit of electronica but enjoyed during the dishes, gave me chvrches vibes. Can't go too far wrong with a Vampire Weekend album, they are always fun regardless of what precise shade of which genre they are.

[4/14/24, 5:09:31 AM] Neil Tilston: Have you got a new theme for us @⁨David Thomas⁩?
[4/14/24, 5:17:15 AM] Fergus Neville: I met Paul Savage last night and was looking forward to him not knowing who Neil was after all his “My pal Paul” boasts. Disappointedly he actually asked me first if I knew his mate Neil 🤣

[4/14/24, 1:24:52 PM] David Thomas: Let’s have some ‘local bands’ - support bands you’ve seen live without knowing who they were, but were better than the headliners, or at least more interesting
[4/14/24, 1:26:34 PM] David Thomas: Went to a punk night last night that Dead Pioneers were listed as playing, but they didn’t show up 😪 so we’re got a bunch of local bands of varying quality, all of much more interesting than the headliners
[4/14/24, 1:28:14 PM] Neil Tilston: I can think of quite a few things for this where the album isn't out yet...
[4/14/24, 1:28:23 PM] Neil Tilston: Will have a think about it
[4/14/24, 1:28:42 PM] Fergus Neville: There was a great support act called The Cords last night. A 2-piece all-girl DIY punk band. They were only 15 and 17 so the venue had to change the licence to 14+ so they could play. Sadly they’ve not released anything yet - apparently they’ve recorded something which will be released on tape (of course it is) at some point.

[4/14/24, 1:33:09 PM] David Thomas: These guys played last night in between a bunch of hard rock/punk bands. Three piece techno wearing silk floral jackets and flowery gimp masks, blew everyone else away.
[4/14/24, 1:33:33 PM] David Thomas: “Doom pop” apparently
[4/14/24, 1:34:20 PM] David Thomas: It’s probably unlistenable
[4/14/24, 4:46:52 PM] Neil Tilston: Not far off...
[4/14/24, 4:47:44 PM] Neil Tilston: Imagine someone asked the question what would Ladytron crossed with the sex pistols sound like
[4/14/24, 4:47:54 PM] Neil Tilston: And didn't realise the answer was awful
[4/14/24, 4:48:34 PM] Neil Tilston: It's a bit electroclash (anyone else remember that shot loved "genre"?)
[4/14/24, 4:48:41 PM] Neil Tilston: *lived
[4/14/24, 4:50:29 PM] David Thomas: They were really good live - bananas and chaotic, but really sounded great
[4/14/24, 4:52:45 PM] Neil Tilston: Reminded me a bit of the band in mighty boosh

[4/15/24, 2:59:24 AM] Rory Edwards: Very hard to find bands like this on Spotify at least. I remember a few from back in the day but their music seems to only be on the web in bits and pieces.
[4/15/24, 3:00:45 AM] Neil Tilston: Back in the day it was always Hazey Janes in Dundee and Broken Records in Edinburgh. Both of them have many records on Spotify...
[4/15/24, 3:00:51 AM] Neil Tilston: I'm going to go more recent.
[4/15/24, 3:01:51 AM] Neil Tilston: These two brothers are from Newport-on-Tay and I've seen them supporting both SHHE (at the Rio!) and Andrew Wasylyk at the Gardyne.  They make cool ambient soundscapes and use a lot of field recordings.
[4/15/24, 3:02:17 AM] Neil Tilston: Give this album a listen: Cryptophasia
https://open.spotify.com/album/2mTfepd85rQgtTL6D0LIUb?si=eZtas0ZXS7a0hUveODD3Hg
[4/15/24, 3:03:08 AM] Rory Edwards: I remember been blown away by the 44s (Glasgow ska outfit) and Kill the Last Romantic (Indie lot, very 00s) but both are now hard to find.
[4/15/24, 3:04:06 AM] Rory Edwards: Anyway about a decade ago I saw this lot supporting someone or other. Maybe they opened for the National at the Roundhouse, poss not, was at the Roundhouse anyway. They were great but album wasn't out and I forgot all about them.
[4/15/24, 3:05:13 AM] Rory Edwards: Haven't listened at all since but they.have a few albums so must be doing alright.
[4/15/24, 3:05:26 AM] Rory Edwards: Probably in a bit in London way.

[4/15/24, 4:58:13 AM] Rory Edwards: Big* in London
[4/16/24, 9:45:32 AM] Rory Edwards: I thought this had its moments, going for that poppy post hardcore thing but they possibly don't really know what post-hardcore is and have kin of reinvented it by accident.
[4/16/24, 9:45:50 AM] Rory Edwards: Not coherent enough to be a really good record but some good grooves and nonsense moments.
[4/16/24, 9:46:23 AM] Rory Edwards: That said, I did suddenly pick out a great tune and was like "how can anyone say this is not a complete banger".
[4/16/24, 9:46:38 AM] Rory Edwards: Thing is the album had ended and that tune was by Lilith on artist radio.
[4/16/24, 9:46:55 AM] Rory Edwards: Still much more listenable than @⁨Fergus Neville⁩'s pick this week.

[4/16/24, 9:55:41 AM] Fergus Neville: A bit further north. Bergen.
[4/16/24, 9:56:52 AM] Rory Edwards: Ah cool. Never quite got that far. Been to Haugesund. Looks very similar but can't think why you would go there!
[4/16/24, 10:27:17 AM] Fergus Neville: Raveloe also supported Broken Chanter on Saturday and were excellent. She’s supporting Randolph’s Leap at our gig in August, but that was their choice as much as ours and I’d never seen her live before. I thought she was great.

[4/16/24, 12:04:54 PM] Fergus Neville: Thursday night. Only arrived this morning.
[4/16/24, 12:05:59 PM] Neil Tilston: Up for radio show on Sunday? 🤞
[4/16/24, 12:07:33 PM] Fergus Neville: In principle yes, but it’ll be tricky as Finlay has a tennis tournament in Perth and so as an absent Dad this week I’ll probably either be there or off on a walk with Aoife and Etive. I’ll come if I can, but best to get some others on board too.

[4/17/24, 11:54:05 AM] David Thomas: Loving this - really charming, poppy and upbeat version of Sigurd ros. “Don’t fall in the Thames on your way home, you’ll get stuck”
[4/17/24, 11:57:41 AM] Neil Tilston: I liked it too. I thought it was just ok at the start then hit a real purple patch in the middle Back to just ok at the end. Over all 7/10 but really first third 6/10 middle third 9/10 last third 6/10.
‎[4/17/24, 11:58:26 AM] Neil Tilston: ‎image omitted
[4/17/24, 2:19:50 PM] Rory Edwards: They didn't sound nearly as.much like Sigur Ros as I remembered! Agree entirely with your thoughts. Was worried after three tunes it might descend into an indie clogfest but then accelerated nicely into a world of staccato guitars and nuclear paranoia.
[4/17/24, 2:20:01 PM] Rory Edwards: Will have to listen back to some of their other stuff.
[4/17/24, 2:24:10 PM] Neil Tilston: I honestly have no idea why anybody thinks it sounds like sigur ros tbh
[4/18/24, 7:41:50 AM] Rory Edwards: I really like this. An atmospheric record that at times reminded me of Skinny Fists. It doesn't land things quite but loads to be admired. Great album to work to.
[4/18/24, 7:42:45 AM] Rory Edwards: Tune in the middle wouldn't download for some reason which is odd. Maybe a Dee exclusive or something.
[4/18/24, 7:44:40 AM] Neil Tilston: No idea why all streams and downloads for mw
[4/18/24, 7:45:58 AM] Rory Edwards: Dee exclusive confirmed. Amusingly the track is called Sight Unseen 🤣
[4/18/24, 7:46:23 AM] Neil Tilston: I listen to quite a lot of this kind of thing and I do genuinely think this is really high quality. I can see why you'd compare it with GY!BE bit I think it's certainly never aiming for the same type of intensity and crescendo that they go for. Think it's a more ambient and reflective style they're going for. More like say Brian eno or indeed Andrew Wasylyk
[4/18/24, 7:49:18 AM] Rory Edwards: Yeah I can get that, I'm a bit of a sucker for a crescendo which skews my view. It maybe isn't meant to land particularly, it's just happy being. Still probably an 8/10 for me.
[4/18/24, 7:49:35 AM] Rory Edwards: Needs the right setting.
[4/18/24, 8:37:34 AM] Neil Tilston: Best track imo 😳

[4/19/24, 2:53:00 AM] Neil Tilston: Holy snakes are a great local band and I saw them years ago with Fergus supporting Savage Mansion. Caught them again last night supporting Jutebox. Both bands were ace. The most recent HS track is particularly strong.

[4/20/24, 3:15:09 AM] Fergus Neville: Album Club is so big now that artists thank us in their sleeve notes when they’re picked
[4/20/24, 4:58:52 AM] Fergus Neville: Twisting it slightly, this was a support act I’d not heard of supporting a local band…Franz Ferdinand were the hottest ticket in town for the Barrowlands after their debut album. They were great, but imo The Kills were even better and have been one of my favourite bands ever since ‎<This message was edited>

[4/20/24, 1:22:40 PM] Fergus Neville: Playing a festival in Dundee in Sept! Great live band. I remember Tim coming out at T in the Park with his Flaming V guitar shooting flames and launched into Girl from Mars 🔥
[4/20/24, 1:39:23 PM] David Thomas: This is great!
[4/20/24, 1:39:47 PM] David Thomas: Got me dancing round the Supermarket

[4/22/24, 9:18:56 AM] Rory Edwards: Ah cool. I almost picked some obscure industrial EDM vaguely more in line with Yard Act as a theme but then I tried to listen to all of it and just couldn't.
[4/22/24, 9:19:25 AM] Rory Edwards: Maybe it will come out for bangers.

[4/22/24, 12:48:30 PM] David Thomas: This is obviously great, but first time listening all the way through and I was a bit disappointed that it wasn’t as wierd as I’d hoped - the track ‘Blackpool Illuminations’ puts that fear to rest nicely
[4/22/24, 12:48:54 PM] David Thomas: It’s ace, top class
[4/22/24, 12:49:43 PM] Neil Tilston: Hard agree
[4/22/24, 12:49:55 PM] Neil Tilston: Why do they keep leaving their best tracks off the albums?
[4/22/24, 12:50:17 PM] David Thomas: Yeah - was pondering that too, and I think I love it
[4/22/24, 12:50:30 PM] Neil Tilston: Nothing on the first album was as good as fixer upper and nothing on this matches trenchcoat museum
[4/22/24, 12:51:37 PM] Neil Tilston: Yeah I mean it's very good and they're clearly a great band doing interesting things. But they're making 8/10 albums when you feel they're capable of 10/10s based on moments
[4/22/24, 12:52:00 PM] David Thomas: Embrace the EP Neil
[4/22/24, 12:55:17 PM] Neil Tilston: Trenchcoat museum was a single only not an ep. And the ep featuring Fixer upper was never available to buy in UK.

[4/22/24, 1:01:29 PM] David Thomas: I really like the transition they’ve made away from almost novelty post punk songs, this feels much more like they’ve confidently settled into their sound a bit, reminds me of hot chip (or at least 2bears). Agree that there’s less stand out bangers on here, but like the flow of the album a lot
[4/22/24, 1:02:23 PM] Neil Tilston: I liked the one where he talks about his childhood and reflects on bullying his friend. Is it down by the river? A very engaging listen
[4/22/24, 1:03:09 PM] Neil Tilston: It does lull a bit in the middle of the album though
[4/22/24, 1:03:13 PM] David Thomas: Yeah, and then the call back to the story on ‘Blackpool illuminations”
[4/22/24, 3:03:49 PM] David Thomas: Any background on this Neil? I was expecting to know a track on this but nothing rings a bell
[4/22/24, 3:40:25 PM] Neil Tilston: Gav spins it a lot on Tuesday

[4/23/24, 7:11:40 AM] Fergus Neville: I enjoyed this a lot too. A little Radio 2 in places, but overall a good listen.
[4/25/24, 2:58:15 PM] David Thomas: was planning on posting my favorite lyrics from 'where's my utopia' on another listen back today, but got distracts by the Dark Days' EP - best yard act lyrics by far (3min setup just for this perfect lyric); "It takes real guts to fake being nuts, and it takes real nuts to break fake guts". https://open.spotify.com/track/5jFUPZorX1LgmpweWA23KT?si=71652befa7824144
[4/25/24, 3:05:28 PM] Rory Edwards: That's also extremely cool cover art.
[4/25/24, 3:46:01 PM] Neil Tilston: Is this the most Dave Strums album ever?

It sounds like Jenny Lewis fronting up drive by truckers!

I knew the structured class song already - think you picked it for singles.
[4/25/24, 3:46:12 PM] Neil Tilston: Anyway it's my favourite this week!
[4/25/24, 3:46:34 PM] David Thomas: "Is this the most Dave Strums album ever?" ??

[4/25/24, 3:47:31 PM] Neil Tilston: Also bad day for the group chat is a great title with some wonderful tongue in cheek lyrics
[4/25/24, 3:48:29 PM] Neil Tilston: I've been waiting all my life for some decent tax advice in particular reminded me of half man half biscuit
[4/25/24, 3:48:36 PM] David Thomas: i'm glad you liked it - i can't decide if its good or terribley cringy
[4/25/24, 3:48:43 PM] Neil Tilston: Both
[4/25/24, 3:48:47 PM] Neil Tilston: Loved it
[4/25/24, 3:49:09 PM] Neil Tilston: I took it as humour and loved it for it
[4/25/24, 3:49:34 PM] David Thomas: has a musical theatre vibe to it

The latter had some great stories about the Liverpool music scene in the 80s and I've bought his book. He talked a lot about accidently forming a band with Ian Broudie after writing this song together:

[5/1/24, 9:28:34 AM] David Thomas: this has been on my headphones for a few weeks - their current single is with Grian Chatten off of FontainsDC and the local radio station has been hammering it for a while now. Suspect if this was all in English it would be absolute tripe; drugs, misogyny, arbitrary use of sweary words - but the use of Irish drags you in, and I think its great.  clever use of slang/irish eg album title CAG means "trí chonsan agus guta" ("three consonants and a vowel"), slang for MDMA.

[5/3/24, 2:38:53 AM] Rory Edwards: Not sure about the last past of this, I do think it's a great album though. Huge transcendent stirring sound on one level and musically intricate full of awesome details on another.
[5/3/24, 2:39:34 AM] Rory Edwards: You don't get many non English albums that have such broad cultural impact. It's very, very good. A rare excellent pick from @⁨Fergus Neville⁩ 😜
[5/3/24, 2:41:42 AM] Rory Edwards: I enjoyed this a lot too. Another record with a big sound. Great sense of rhythm, never quite new where it was going next but all held together.
[5/3/24, 2:41:45 AM] Rory Edwards: Came second in a club time trial and won a £10.vlucher for Costa while listening as well.
[5/3/24, 2:42:33 AM] Rory Edwards: It's maybe a little weird we haven't had these guys as they are properly huge in the Spanish speaking world, including weirdly.spain, which is odd for a band not from there.
[5/3/24, 2:43:31 AM] Rory Edwards: That's because they use quite a traditional Spanish style, loads of cool nylon guitar paired with acoustic rhythm work. Lots of vibraslap!
[5/3/24, 2:44:06 AM] Rory Edwards: I really.like it but it does go on a bit. The pop switch ups they are known for a welcome distraction. The skits not so much.
[5/3/24, 2:44:35 AM] Rory Edwards: Btw love songs and songs of home going on a bit is also very Spanish. Why skip the key change.

I'm picking this summery track from a previous @⁨Fergus Neville⁩ album pick
[5/3/24, 3:11:50 AM] Neil Tilston: Glad you liked it. A contemporary record but very much in the traditional afro Cuban jazz style popularised by Buena vista social club. It's on daptone who usually specialise in contemporary artists with a classic funk and soul sound (Charles Bradley, budos band, Sharon Jones, lee fields, menhan at band etc). This is the only Latin act I'm aware of on the roster but think it's very cool since Germain introduced me to it.
[5/3/24, 3:13:04 AM] Neil Tilston: This didn't work for me. Felt like hyper produced pop and went on far too long. The Latin touches could probably have kept me interested for a track or two but it was too much of the same thing for me sorry. A rare pan 🍳
[5/3/24, 3:14:16 AM] Neil Tilston: Talk is not my favourite sigur ros album but I do think it's amazing. Iceland's answer who sing in Icelandic and sometimes a made up language sound very much like the kind of band that only harcore Radiohead fans and DnD nerds should be into...
[5/3/24, 3:15:15 AM] Neil Tilston: So for them to decide on their fourth album to make a ln "accessible record" and "go mainstream" in principle should be ridiculous. But they only pulled it off.
[5/3/24, 3:15:46 AM] Neil Tilston: The album is beautiful and euphoric and with a bit of help from David Attenborough absolutely did bring them to a mainstream audience. Major props
[5/3/24, 3:16:25 AM] Neil Tilston: ( ) is their masterpiece though - as a post rock purist I king help but find Talk a little too easy.
[5/3/24, 3:16:34 AM] Neil Tilston: Still a 9/10 and my favourite of the week
[5/3/24, 3:16:59 AM] Neil Tilston: Really enjoyed this. More of this sort of nonsense please 👍👍

I think we've had a few Mogwai albums but not the most recent

[5/5/24, 9:23:39 AM] David Thomas: Think I’ve said this before, but REM are the best album band of our lifetimes.
[5/5/24, 9:26:24 AM] David Thomas: I think this is their 10th album
[5/5/24, 9:57:29 AM] Neil Tilston: I think I described an album previously as the most @⁨David Thomas⁩ pick ever.

Well the closer on this has to be in the running for the most @⁨Rory Edwards⁩ track ever
By Frank Turner ✅
About leaving London city ✅
Kurt Vonnegut reference ✅
[5/6/24, 2:28:50 PM] David Thomas: @⁨Rory Edwards⁩ this is a great theme - really enjoying going back and listening to a bunch of albums from these bands to see how the later stuff holds up.
[5/6/24, 2:29:25 PM] David Thomas: currently trying to see how loud i can play mogwaii in my office before my boss complains
[5/6/24, 3:46:33 PM] Rory Edwards: Fair. A few daddy issues as well for good measure, although dad hasn't started cross dressing just yet.
[5/6/24, 3:55:32 PM] Neil Tilston: I was talking about the last track in particular. But that track is also very memorable!
[5/6/24, 4:00:58 PM] Rory Edwards: The genius of that closer for me is the last chord. Off key and unfinished. A step out into the unknown.
[5/6/24, 4:01:37 PM] Rory Edwards: I.have overthought this album which I'm sure you're all desperate to hear me go on about for ages 😜
[5/6/24, 4:33:27 PM] Neil Tilston: I did enjoy it. But Frank is like the dictionary definition of earnest when it comes to lyrics right? He just says exactly what he means. Forgive me but surely there's absolutely nothing hidden or subtle about it? It's part of his schtick/appeal for sure as he pulls it off though.
[5/6/24, 4:35:45 PM] Rory Edwards: Yeah pretty much. There are no hidden meanings particularly - an occasional incredibly obvious metaphor. He deals with his shit in public.

[5/7/24, 5:11:37 AM] Fergus Neville: I see Frank Turner broke the world record at the most gigs in 24 hours in support of independent venues. He is a bit of a dude isn't he?

[5/7/24, 9:17:18 AM] David Thomas: Any protests on st. Andrews campus @⁨Fergus Neville⁩ ?
[5/7/24, 9:48:38 AM] Fergus Neville: There have been weekly lunchtime protests calling for a ceasefire for months, but no occupations or too much which drags university policy into it that I know of. We’re done with exams now (into marking season - yuck) so the UGs are beginning to bugger off anyway.
[5/8/24, 8:01:15 AM] Neil Tilston: Did @⁨Fergus Neville⁩ pick an album yet?

[5/8/24, 10:15:45 AM] Fergus Neville: Not yet, although I have enjoyed all 3 of your picks. I've been listening to various options and will choose one soon.
[5/8/24, 10:16:20 AM] David Thomas: Is it Wednesday there too?
[5/8/24, 10:16:37 AM] Fergus Neville: It was a bank holiday on Monday, so technically it's still Tuesday.
[5/8/24, 10:16:41 AM] Fergus Neville: Sort of
[5/8/24, 10:17:02 AM] Fergus Neville: The delay is that you've all picked the usual white blokes and I don't want to make it a clean sweep
[5/8/24, 10:17:23 AM] David Thomas: Fair enough
[5/8/24, 10:17:41 AM] Fergus Neville: I'll faff some more then pick The Beatles obvs
[5/8/24, 10:18:46 AM] Fergus Neville: I don't understand what/who this is despite a cursory Google
[5/8/24, 10:20:17 AM] David Thomas: I’ve definitely picked em before
[5/8/24, 10:22:01 AM] Fergus Neville: Wanted to pick HEY WHAT by Low, but I see someone (me?) already picked it. Listening to it now though anyway because it absolutely rules.
[5/8/24, 10:25:45 AM] Neil Tilston: A single-in September 2021 I believe. Shameful that Fergus didn't remember 😂
[5/8/24, 10:31:14 AM] David Thomas: Really?! Was convinced I’d picked at least one album
[5/8/24, 10:31:57 AM] David Thomas: I forget how much cooler I am than you’s

Saw/hewrd this and instantly thought "This might be Mogwai"
[5/8/24, 12:06:51 PM] Fergus Neville: Few artists have had the staying power of Madonna. Not necessarily my favourite music, but it feels an oversight not to have had her yet. So let's listen to some Madge:

[5/8/24, 12:08:24 PM] David Thomas: Nice
[5/8/24, 12:08:37 PM] David Thomas: Completely disregarded the theme, but picks a banger
[5/8/24, 12:09:50 PM] Fergus Neville: 1984 feels like more than 20 years to me Strim
[5/8/24, 12:30:03 PM] Neil Tilston: Is it not meant to be an album from the artist after they've been making music for 20 years/10 albums though ‎<This message was edited>
[5/8/24, 12:30:18 PM] Neil Tilston: So you should really be picking a later Madonna album
[5/8/24, 12:30:32 PM] Neil Tilston: That's how I interpreted it
[5/8/24, 12:37:58 PM] David Thomas: yeah ferg
[5/8/24, 12:38:11 PM] David Thomas: this is great tho
[5/8/24, 12:39:46 PM] Fergus Neville: It depends how you interpret the “or”. I did look at her later stuff but didn’t know any of the tunes.
[5/8/24, 12:40:08 PM] David Thomas: "later albums"
[5/8/24, 12:47:19 PM] Fergus Neville: Did I pick her debut?
[5/8/24, 12:47:25 PM] Fergus Neville: No I did not.
[5/8/24, 12:47:35 PM] Fergus Neville: I picked one later than that. ‎<This message was edited>

[5/9/24, 4:39:02 PM] Rory Edwards: I have thoughts on albums I'll post tomorrow,.but as a heads up the bangers theme is tunes from the other end of your pick's career so we get the contrast. Ferg that means picking a recent Madonna song!

[5/10/24, 11:33:20 AM] Rory Edwards: Aye.
[5/10/24, 11:36:59 AM] Rory Edwards: I like this album a lot, which makes sense given it's the most Rory Edwards album ever. Probably my second favorite Frank album nowadays. Showcases various aspects of his style really well, nice and varied turning up the noise in places and the heartstrings in others, no song based on a terrible metaphor, huge insight into his story and character which I find really relatable despite my lack of drug addiction.
[5/10/24, 11:42:56 AM] Neil Tilston: Is running not a drug then?
[5/10/24, 11:43:02 AM] Neil Tilston: 😜
[5/10/24, 11:43:06 AM] Rory Edwards: Maybe the thing I like about it best though is how strong it is thematically. It closes off a chapter in his life with several of the songs (most notably the Resurrectionists) referring directly back to earlier work. Frank's music has basically been all about the mess he was in and his recovery and although he still has his wobbles he seems basically there. Leaving London, settling down with his partner, and reconciling with his dad are all things that happened but they are also symbolic of that growth.
[5/10/24, 11:43:16 AM] Rory Edwards: lol debatable.
[5/10/24, 11:44:28 AM] Rory Edwards: I am not sure what him being done with this stuff says for the future of his music, what does a tortured artist do when they find happiness? Listening to Girl in The Record Shop I have concerns but am pleased for him in the meantime.
[5/10/24, 11:44:52 AM] Rory Edwards: Akin to vinyl shopping.
[5/10/24, 11:45:11 AM] Neil Tilston: Definitely
[5/10/24, 11:45:22 AM] Neil Tilston: Coke would be cheaper
[5/10/24, 11:46:52 AM] Rory Edwards: So it goes.
[5/10/24, 11:49:09 AM] Rory Edwards: I thought this was really good. I have always found Mogwai albums to be very dark but maybe that was because they were stuck on earth. This "binned" that in the first ten seconds and went intergalactic. A soaring, heady listen. I am not sure how much they use a vocal but I enjoyed it when they did. Drove me on while I was self-medicating. Maybe I'm finally getting them.
[5/10/24, 11:49:52 AM] Neil Tilston: Scotland's greatest ever band imo
[5/10/24, 11:54:30 AM] Rory Edwards: I liked this a lot too, very melodic. Some big highlights. the Departure and Low Desert two of them for me, a bit of filler. About 10 times better than what passes for Indie Rock nowadays, wish it had had a tighter edit.
[5/10/24, 11:55:11 AM] Rory Edwards: They must have a shout to be fair, to be putting out relevant stuff for so long and have such success in a pretty niche genre is incredible.
[5/10/24, 11:57:50 AM] Rory Edwards: Where to start with this? With the singles obviously which are GOAT level pop songs. I thought there was a fair bit of mushy 80s filler in there too though - nothing wrong with the vocal, lyrics just a bit shallow and the production somewhat dialed in. A few more sparks of life near the end but she's a singles artist for me.

[5/11/24, 12:23:44 PM] Fergus Neville: This is a Dundee band who have been going for years. Albini was always a fan and produced their last two albums. He was also spotted wearing their t-shirt while playing in his own band.

[5/14/24, 4:13:05 AM] Rory Edwards: Have never listened before. Got me wondering about other folk whose production work is more celebrated than their "own" stuff. We've had a few recently that spring to mind. Jack Antonoff certainly, you could argue Aaron Dessner nowadays despite the fact he is in a massive global band. Trent Reznor won an oscar for Social Network.

[5/17/24, 7:24:28 AM] Rory Edwards: Interesting to have this one up alongside The Breeders given it was very much Kim's tune.
[5/17/24, 7:28:39 AM] Neil Tilston: I have two contenders I can't choose between so hoping @⁨David Thomas⁩ picks one for me and makes my choice easier!
[5/17/24, 7:30:03 AM] Rory Edwards: Hope folk enjoyed Pod, enjoyed might be the wrong word, it is compelling and almost off-putting, appealing to base instincts. All angular guitars and dirty metaphor. Chugging along. Sexy almost but only in the same way porn is. Still it's some experience - 5* imo.
[5/17/24, 7:31:15 AM] Rory Edwards: I had never listened to McClusky so Dallas in its entirety before and that had similar qualities. Also very much enjoyed.
[5/17/24, 7:32:25 AM] Rory Edwards: Albini seems to be at his best when his raw philosophy brings to life suitable subject matter. Sex in multiple cases this week.
[5/17/24, 7:33:27 AM] Rory Edwards: Very much admire his commitment to a philosophy, has created such a distinctive body of work while at the same time letting artists shine through.
[5/17/24, 8:30:17 AM] Rory Edwards: Realise I haven't talked about Jarvis. Love Pulp thought the high points (Richard) were high and the low points (Dinosaur bone jolk with triangle) were low.
[5/17/24, 8:31:44 AM] Rory Edwards: Both Jarvis and McCluskey albums seemed to view pulling and sex as some sort of spectator sport they were ashamed to also participate in. The others were very much enjoying the leeriness.
[5/17/24, 10:33:49 AM] Fergus Neville: Great reviews Rory 👍
[5/17/24, 10:36:19 AM] Fergus Neville: I received my vinyl copy of the debut Afterlands album this week and the artwork is beautiful. I'm not sure who has done it, but there's such an awesome dark visual branding to that band which fits the music perfectly. It also helps that the record is superb (possibly my favourite new release of the year?). Still mindblowing that they played their debut show for BRR at the Rio.

So this week's theme is striking/iconic/favourite artwork (although the music needs to be good too!)

ODB using his welfare card for album art is genius imo
[5/17/24, 2:02:34 PM] David Thomas: I somehow missed that you’d picked this for foreign language bangers - absolute cracker of a pick Ferg
[5/17/24, 2:02:53 PM] Fergus Neville: YES!
[5/17/24, 2:03:15 PM] Fergus Neville: I was very pleased with it and hoped for more of a response. Delayed recognition FTW!
[5/19/24, 6:57:05 AM] Neil Tilston: I am similarly biased but agree it's one of the most engaging and haunting albums of the year. Currently listening weekly and expecting it to stay in rotation for a long time to come 👌
[5/19/24, 6:58:29 AM] Neil Tilston: Roxy music are an intriguing band to me because they're highly acclaimed and often compared to many artists and bands I rate very highly.  They also launched Brian Eno's career which is certainly a very cool and interesting story (I think this is the last album he was still with them for).

But I don't really like them.
[5/19/24, 6:58:58 AM] Neil Tilston: I think the opening track is very typical of their style and I can't stand it.
[5/19/24, 6:59:46 AM] Neil Tilston: I think it's Ferry I don't like. He sounds like a cruise ship crooner doing some weird Frank Sinatra meets David Bowie theatrical hybrid and it just gets on my tits.
[5/19/24, 6:59:54 AM] Neil Tilston: Sorry I can't get past it.
[5/19/24, 7:01:01 AM] Neil Tilston: I mean I did listen to the whole album and it's not all that bad ( I liked the long track with the cool funky instrumental -Bryan shuts up for a bit , phew).

But I don't think I'm ever going to get into this band.
[5/20/24, 10:53:33 AM] Rory Edwards: Lol swing and a miss for you mate. It's crazy how much not liking a vocal can destroy something. I get a same thing with The Shins - a band that must have been recommended to me a 100 times including multiple times by my wife.
[5/20/24, 10:57:18 AM] Rory Edwards: I think this album is a cool theatrical combo of rock, glam and jazz. Toys around with big ideas like love and the nature of reality without really examining them too deeply. It's all a bit akin to musical theatre, loads of bombast alongside epic guitar and sax, but comes with bonus musical quality. I like musical theatre so that suits me.
[5/20/24, 10:58:41 AM] Rory Edwards: The Bowie comparison is apt - I think they've got a lot in common - although I don't think they are on his level in terms of a body of work.
[5/20/24, 10:58:48 AM] Rory Edwards: I would have said there is much to acclaim but now I can't help but look at it through the lens of the first class lounge on a saga holiday.
[5/20/24, 11:57:39 AM] Neil Tilston: Sorry!
[5/20/24, 5:12:53 PM] Fergus Neville: LOVE this! Sounds like a rootsy Joanna Newsom!
[5/21/24, 3:24:22 AM] Neil Tilston: Cuttin headz is the final track on this really. Anything after is bonus material

On again the now 😃
[5/22/24, 1:27:04 PM] David Thomas: ya big grump Neil, thought this was good fun. probably wont listen back again, but it was enjoyable enough
[5/23/24, 6:40:40 AM] Fergus Neville: I hadn't heard this before (other than Shimmy) and enjoyed it overall, but it reinforced my opion that hip-hop is a single rather than album genre. There are some great singles, but the skits and chat are dreadful. I've never understood why rappers think anyone wants to listen them pretending them to have sex (same criticism applies to the Biggie Smalls album I picked)?!

[5/23/24, 11:42:23 AM] Rory Edwards: Skits are sometimes naff I agree but to take that and say hip hop isn't an 'album genre' is pure takery.
[5/23/24, 11:52:01 AM] Rory Edwards: I actually really enjoyed this although I wasn't expecting to particularly. Had a great groove to it. Dirty as advertised. Interesting how much he used the Wu Tang 'brand' within it. Didn't really notice the skits much so not too intrusive this time for me.
[5/23/24, 11:53:50 AM] Rory Edwards: I don't particularly get the motivation  for making albums about bitches and hoes etc but as a valve for toxic masculinity this is better than nu-metal.
[5/23/24, 11:56:51 AM] Rory Edwards: This is class. Darth Jenny Lewis meets alternative universe Emmy the Great.
[5/23/24, 11:57:44 AM] Rory Edwards: This is also class. Melodic and haunting, deeply rooted in land and place. Sometimes bleak and sometimes beautiful.
[5/23/24, 11:57:58 AM] Rory Edwards: They are launching it in Leith so I was looking up tickets.
[5/23/24, 12:15:27 PM] Neil Tilston: I always think ODB played up heavily to his stage persona in this regard. By many accounts he was actually (relatively) very decent to his partners over the years. Definitely a complex character as evidenced by his incarcerations and substance abuse. But yeah the idea of misogyny and homophobia being a funny juvenile character is a tough sell . I was worried it would be too much to get past so glad you both managed to find things to enjoy in it
[5/23/24, 12:16:54 PM] Neil Tilston: ODB is interesting to me because of his unique voice. Folk like ODB (see also Busta Rhymes and Biz Mariee) really stand out and shine on posse cuts so he always sounded best in the Wu tang context and I think some of the best tracks on here are when he shares the mic with others .
[5/23/24, 12:18:13 PM] Neil Tilston: The real star for me though is RZA's production. He was absolutely on top of his game here. Taking the ideas from 36 chambers and making it even sparser and murkier. Awesome stuff. 

This and the first gravediggaz albums are his best two productions imo.
[5/23/24, 12:18:47 PM] Neil Tilston: Also really liked this 👍👍
[5/23/24, 3:31:25 PM] David Thomas: glad everyone enjoyed Emerson Wolf - I've gone down a rabbit hole of this kind of indie folk recently, there's some lovely female singer/songers who are writing this kind of filthy folk music - great stuff
[5/23/24, 3:32:18 PM] David Thomas: enjoyed the variety this week - didn't make it through the whole of ODB yet as it was a bit sweary for work, but will stick it back on for a run at some point, liked what i heard
[5/23/24, 3:34:47 PM] David Thomas: I listened to Afterlands and Roxy back to back and found the vocals of a similar style - might not have been paying too much attention though, like them both, but afterlands didnt quite stick with me - was expecting more of a broken chanter vibe, so was a bit dissapointed, but still really good.
[5/23/24, 3:40:20 PM] David Thomas: Rory one of my favorite brands have a motorhead running collaboration; https://roark.com/products/motorhead-ace-of-spades-camper-mens-baseball-caps-rh637
[5/23/24, 3:48:23 PM] Rory Edwards: Won't let me see it as cookies keep throwing me to the UK site. Getting my hat ready for the race at the weekend. Will probably spend far to long deciding to wear it or not.

[5/24/24, 3:10:05 AM] Neil Tilston: Singles requirements?
[5/24/24, 3:30:22 AM] Fergus Neville: Cover art 👍
Or just something which sounds good, whatever!
[5/24/24, 3:38:29 AM] Rory Edwards: Yeah this is the both with 'doing a bit' or whatever. The outcome is often the same. Can't think of any examples of someone using music to do it well although they may exist. A few films have pulled it off.
[5/24/24, 3:42:43 AM] Neil Tilston: Alice cooper?
[5/24/24, 3:53:42 AM] Rory Edwards: Yeah maybe. For years I would have said Marilyn Manson, a notoriously articulate interviewee on things like schools shootings etc, but now he may just be the living embodiment of someone becoming the character.
[5/24/24, 4:07:00 AM] Neil Tilston: Yeah
[5/24/24, 4:07:00 AM] Neil Tilston: What about Bowie?
[5/24/24, 4:07:01 AM] Neil Tilston: Ozzy?
[5/24/24, 4:12:10 AM] Rory Edwards: Yeah I reckon you could be on to two winners there.
[5/24/24, 4:12:59 AM] Rory Edwards: Bowie has the Elvis esque statutory rape issue although I don't think that was to do with any of his characters particularly and more just being a huge star at that time.
[5/24/24, 4:19:29 AM] Rory Edwards: Strange how all of those you mention are similar in some ways, flamboyant, theatrical, giving voice to the weirdos and outsiders of their time. Three of them are metal artists.

[5/27/24, 8:11:39 AM] Rory Edwards: There's a few more photos in the online piece which I'm sharing cause my sister took em.
[5/27/24, 8:24:55 AM] Neil Tilston: Is baby reindeer about robs?
[5/27/24, 3:04:03 PM] Fergus Neville: That’s fantastic! The photos really make it.
[5/28/24, 7:10:01 AM] Rory Edwards: Aww I'll tell her you like them. I love how unvarnished it is compared to almost any other interview you read nowadays. You do feel like you've met him.
[5/28/24, 7:10:22 AM] Rory Edwards: I had never heard of this before my lunchtime news skive https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cl443d48x3yo
[5/28/24, 7:16:24 AM] Fergus Neville: Which is ironic given that he talks about varnish in the interview! ‎<This message was edited>
[5/28/24, 7:17:09 AM] Fergus Neville: I'm sure we've discussed this on here before? Such an indulgent and proposterous concept - love it!
[5/28/24, 8:04:15 AM] David Thomas: That museum sounds delightfully bananas
[5/28/24, 1:57:41 PM] David Thomas: This is great. Proper album like

[5/28/24, 2:07:13 PM] Fergus Neville: Sultans of Swing! 😘 👌
[5/28/24, 2:07:32 PM] Fergus Neville: Sorry, you’ve been bumped by Billy Connelly on request of the kids
[5/28/24, 2:24:03 PM] Fergus Neville: You’re famous Didz
[5/28/24, 2:24:33 PM] Neil Tilston: I thought you bumped us
[5/28/24, 2:25:04 PM] Fergus Neville: We did but just for one sketch. Kids now showering and I have on you doing the dishes
[5/28/24, 2:25:18 PM] Fergus Neville: *you on
[5/28/24, 2:26:49 PM] David Thomas: What did I miss?? I’m listening, but think it’s on delay
[5/28/24, 2:27:15 PM] Fergus Neville: Neil just called you a prick on international radio
[5/28/24, 2:27:48 PM] David Thomas: Fair
[5/28/24, 2:28:02 PM] Neil Tilston: I gave you a shout out

[5/28/24, 3:12:24 PM] Fergus Neville: Such a great weekend
[5/29/24, 12:23:05 PM] David Thomas: Least favorite album of the week. The hits are great, the rest is metal mush ‎<This message was edited>
[5/29/24, 12:23:29 PM] Fergus Neville: I agree
[5/29/24, 12:23:33 PM] Fergus Neville: Except that they're all hits
[5/29/24, 12:23:46 PM] Fergus Neville: (not actually listened yet)
[5/29/24, 12:26:24 PM] Fergus Neville: Tbf I only picked it for the bantz following Rory's chat
[5/29/24, 12:27:20 PM] David Thomas: This is superb - not sure I’ve listened to it all before, really good stuff - a really varied and unique pop sound, 37mins flies by, she’s found that fine line being unique and ironic and vulnerable without sounding forced.
[5/29/24, 12:49:06 PM] Neil Tilston: I love it as well. For me in contemporary pop..
Lorde > Taylor Swift
[5/29/24, 12:58:49 PM] Fergus Neville: I don’t know who Lorde are, but I agree with this ‎<This message was edited>
[5/29/24, 1:09:59 PM] Rory Edwards: Taylor certainly is the bar by which all modern pop is measured 😜
[5/29/24, 1:16:30 PM] Rory Edwards: That said I think this a great album - even more incredible given she was 16 when she made it.
[5/29/24, 1:17:57 PM] Rory Edwards: On that score the vulnerability point is interesting - it's there but she doesn't flaunt it ala Britney Spears. Comes across as very genuine rather than just trying to suck folk in with sex appeal.
[5/29/24, 1:20:34 PM] David Thomas: She’s got her bum out on the cover of her last album tho

[5/29/24, 1:22:17 PM] Rory Edwards: Sex appeal is a tactic many an artist has used.
[5/29/24, 2:50:13 PM] Fergus Neville: I did genuinely laugh out loud at that Rory 👏
[5/29/24, 4:34:01 PM] Rory Edwards: Both hot as fuck imo.
[5/29/24, 4:35:13 PM] Rory Edwards: I find this a bit bloated, so much of the guitar and song structure while maybe technically brilliant is kinda the same. Opening sequence and singles are amazing though obviously.
[5/29/24, 4:35:37 PM] Rory Edwards: Struggling to think of a better opener to any album ever tbh.
[5/31/24, 1:49:16 AM] Neil Tilston: Free choice bangers

[5/31/24, 2:01:08 AM] Rory Edwards: I found this a little patchy depending on whether I got on with the specific synth line, but was still really impressed with it. Crazy ambitious for what I imagine is a small operation. Tune about his (gay?) Muslim mate my favourite.
[5/31/24, 2:01:41 AM] Rory Edwards: I reckon they'll make some great music. Maybe stay away from the synthesised panpipes in future though.
[5/31/24, 2:02:36 AM] Rory Edwards: Thought this was fun too. Early feeder vibes but weirder. Excellent pest control advice.
[5/31/24, 2:04:35 AM] Rory Edwards: Feeling emo https://open.spotify.com/track/6TzJLISIitIzn1WtjDY0Op?si=5mtz2kz1Rtyh1ZiBmzm7aQ
[5/31/24, 2:29:38 AM] Neil Tilston: I really think it's sonically very cool. Taking influence from EDM but creating it in a very DIY fashion. Can't figure out which song that is you're talking about?
[5/31/24, 3:00:44 AM] Rory Edwards: Think it was one of the first couple. Don't get me wrong overall I enjoyed it. Reminded me of the streets and chvrches who I imagine have similar influences.
[5/31/24, 3:03:29 AM] Neil Tilston: Did you listen to a different album?
‎[5/31/24, 3:03:34 AM] Neil Tilston: ‎image omitted
[5/31/24, 3:10:56 AM] Rory Edwards: What you mean the turn I liked? I thought you meant panpipes. The song is Ravvy but it seems from that I misheard the lyrics pretty badly!
[5/31/24, 3:30:04 AM] Neil Tilston: Pretty sure Ravvy is Ravelston Dykes. It's a cliffy bit in north of Edinburgh. The song seems to be a nostalgic ode to underage drinking there
[5/31/24, 3:32:40 AM] Neil Tilston: Lots of references to places in Edinburgh 
D Mains - Davidson's mains
Oshie T - Ocean terminal
[5/31/24, 3:44:46 AM] Rory Edwards: That's where Marie's folks live, or just off it. Think I know the bit they mean up between the golf club and the ridiculous house that plastic surgeon built.

[5/31/24, 9:07:57 AM] Fergus Neville: I'm trying to get some work done, but Rory thinking Ravy Dykes is about a gay Muslim has just ended me
[5/31/24, 9:08:40 AM] Fergus Neville: You're consistently the best at interpreting lyrics Rory (far better than me), so allow us this rare moment of chuckling
[5/31/24, 9:11:19 AM] Rory Edwards: Somewhere in Sundays carnage I lost my headphones so my listening has been a lot less focused this week. If anyone happens to be near Scotmid in Musselburgh do have a scan for them.
[5/31/24, 9:11:34 AM] Fergus Neville: Ah that's a bummer
[5/31/24, 9:11:41 AM] Fergus Neville: Good excuse for new headphone shopping though
[5/31/24, 11:49:25 AM] Fergus Neville: What's the story behind the 'new' release?
[5/31/24, 11:51:00 AM] David Thomas: ‘Lost’ demos, produced by his son
[5/31/24, 11:51:19 AM] Fergus Neville: As long as it's not AI!

[6/7/24, 3:22:00 AM] Rory Edwards: Uplifting bangers sound good to me. Have some music thoughts which I will post later.
[6/7/24, 3:23:05 AM] Rory Edwards: Marathon recovery finally starting to go well.

[6/7/24, 5:52:14 AM] Rory Edwards: Hard agree on this, it isn't high art or anything but it's an awesome bouncy chillout record for a summer day. They have another album that's very similar in terms of vibe and quality called The Palace Garden. Maybe a bit less beachy.
[6/7/24, 5:53:38 AM] Rory Edwards: This was a classic case of something simple done right for me. Tight as fuck. Doesn't take itself too seriously but can still stir a soul A++
[6/7/24, 5:56:12 AM] Rory Edwards: I hadn't properly listened to this before really. Enjoyed it a lot, a joyous celebration of his commitment to his musical style and process. Self confident and lots of fun on a sunny day.
[6/7/24, 5:57:22 AM] Fergus Neville: A colleague of mine told me this week that he's become pals with the FR drummer (Grant Hutcheson) as they both live in Anstruther and have kids the same age. Apparently Grant has set up a boutique Cider shop which is well worth a visit.
[6/7/24, 6:00:11 AM] Rory Edwards: Was not expecting to enjoy this as rockin all over the world is what status quo are in my head and that does my nut in. Found a really fun and varied record, with some great riffs and complex bluesy progressions through it. Finally understand why people like this band so much. ‎<This message was edited>
[6/7/24, 6:01:10 AM] Rory Edwards: That's a cool thing to do with your time. May well try and pop over as isn't far nowadays.
[6/7/24, 6:01:34 AM] Fergus Neville: Status Quo were my second ever gig - my Dad took me to see them in Glasgow as a birthday treat. SECC full of aging rockers head-to-toe in denim - lovely stuff.
[6/7/24, 6:04:40 AM] Rory Edwards: My first was Runrig with my folks - a kilt and leather waistcoats version of the same thing. Suppose Naomi's will be Hamish Hawk 🤣.
[6/7/24, 6:49:53 AM] Neil Tilston: Agree with this. Spent a good check of my listening thinking "wow this isn't shit". Much more varied than I expected. Particularly enjoyed the proggy "a year" 👍
[6/7/24, 6:50:59 AM] Neil Tilston: Glad you enjoyed. A very fun celebratory hip hop record. Great moments from Chali 2na of Jurassic 5 and abdominal but Format's beats and scratching the real star
[6/7/24, 6:51:34 AM] Neil Tilston: This was a bit forgettable for me I'm afraid @⁨David Thomas⁩ . I did listen but it didn't really grab me - sorry

[6/10/24, 6:35:45 AM] Neil Tilston: Really enjoying the record - finding it hard to contain my excitement
[6/10/24, 6:37:02 AM] Fergus Neville: Put a lid on it
[6/10/24, 6:38:03 AM] Neil Tilston: Want to turn the volume up but afraid it'll lead to TINnitus
[6/10/24, 6:38:49 AM] Neil Tilston: I know this gets called Krautrock but it's so varied. Actually surprisingly hard to put a label on it

[6/12/24, 3:50:22 PM] David Thomas: I've listened through Can three times, and still feel like i need to listen again to figure it out. absolutlely massive scope, stonking sound and sounds like its brand new

[6/13/24, 5:51:13 AM] Fergus Neville: Really enjoying Parov Stelar this morning! @⁨Neil Tilston⁩
[6/13/24, 5:52:41 AM] Rory Edwards: Yeah it's a really great record. Breaks a lot of rules that should make it a mess but somehow brings them together as something new. Reminds me of Radiohead in that regard. No clue what it's all about though.
[6/13/24, 6:00:11 AM] Fergus Neville: What happend to Flick fae Neighbours?!

[6/13/24, 6:02:47 AM] Rory Edwards: "Valance, 41, who now lives in the UK with her billionaire property developer and Tory Party donor husband Nick Candy, told GB News earlier this year that "everyone starts as a lefty", but "wakes up... then realise what crap ideas they all are”.

"And then you go to the right.”
[6/13/24, 6:03:06 AM] Fergus Neville: Quite the character arc, even for Neighbours
[6/13/24, 6:04:42 AM] Rory Edwards: I bet Neighbours has done an minted tech guy character since we last watched it, that bloke from Lasiters or whatever it was called was small beer.
[6/13/24, 6:07:45 AM] Fergus Neville: Yeah, but to be fair he then joined The Wedding Present and became John Peel's favourite songwriter
[6/13/24, 6:10:02 AM] Rory Edwards: Eh? Also I've just looked at the list of people that have been in The Wedding Present and lol, that has to be some sort of record.

[6/14/24, 9:29:57 AM] David Thomas: Der football völlig losgelöst
[6/14/24, 9:34:28 AM] Rory Edwards: Echoing this. Enjoyed all this week's picks. Found Hinds to have a really laid back almost Surf Rock vibe. Captured the hopes, fears and fun of youth - wine and saliva. A bit like Dehd but less arty.
[6/14/24, 9:36:32 AM] David Thomas: My conclusions after a 4th and 5th listen is the first half of this a masterpiece, and then it goes completely off the rails in the 2nd half and looses me ‎<This message was edited>
[6/14/24, 9:39:35 AM] Rory Edwards: Interested to hear thoughts on Kraftwerk. I can't say I love them to be honest but you can hear how influential they are on this record. That steady ratcheting build up underpins near enough every dance track forever. My only complaint about some of the tunes on this is that they don't really resolve, it's like they fall in love with a single sound and just keep playing it for six minutes. When they do land though it's amazing, beautiful cinematic soundscapes despite having almost no vocal to speak of (sic). Metropolis I think the best example on this one.
[6/14/24, 9:39:37 AM] Rory Edwards: Hadn't notice that Big Black tune was a cover till you pointed it out Neil. Maybe it was mentioned but I must have glossed over.
[6/14/24, 9:40:04 AM] Rory Edwards: The fact you had to listen five times to decide this shows how it's actually extremely cool and good.
[6/14/24, 9:42:55 AM] Rory Edwards: Found this a slick pop record with lots of cool jazzy and electronic overtones. You can practically hear Kraftwerk on the opener so it was cool playing them back to back by chance. It's fun rather than deep for me but it's very well crafted/
[6/14/24, 9:54:05 AM] Neil Tilston: Glad you liked it. Grant has been playing this in heavy rotation on Tuesdays and I'm really enjoying!

[6/26/24, 4:51:16 PM] Rory Edwards: This is so laid back it is practically horizontal. Live they gave it a lot more flourish but I still like it on record. Sample fodder.
[6/26/24, 4:52:13 PM] Rory Edwards: They don't make much music like this anymore and they should. Reminiscent of Avalanches and similar genre splitting stuff. Seems to mainly be about having taken a lot of drugs.
[6/26/24, 4:53:00 PM] Neil Tilston: I really enjoyed it - was perfect for driving around doing jobs on a hot muggy Monday evening 🔥
[6/26/24, 4:53:35 PM] Rory Edwards: Yeah definitely warm weather music.
[6/26/24, 5:00:59 PM] Neil Tilston: This was a lot of fun. Was pleasantly surprised by how jazzy it was. Lots of lovely sax. Just varied enough to justify the run time
[6/27/24, 3:53:09 PM] Rory Edwards: Having a celebration beer while pretending I'm in a french nightclub. 45 mins of this would be good but two hours is unfathomable without some sort of substance imo. Doesn't mean it's not good though, I like it.
[6/27/24, 3:54:25 PM] Fergus Neville: What’s the celebration?
[6/27/24, 3:56:49 PM] Rory Edwards: Have been on a bit of a health rollercoaster recently. Two different things that present together suggested a chronic auto immune condition that's a bit nasty because it bores holes in your guts. A specific type of Crohn's.
[6/27/24, 3:57:58 PM] Rory Edwards: They put me under today to check. Turns out the two things are unrelated and much more manageable on their own.
[6/27/24, 3:58:45 PM] Fergus Neville: Great news!
[6/27/24, 3:59:17 PM] Fergus Neville: Another good pal of mine just got diagnosed with Crohn’s. Not nice at all.
[6/27/24, 4:03:23 PM] Rory Edwards: Ah sorry to hear it. There's a big spectrum it seems so hope he doesn't get it too badly. I was very glad to hear it wasn't that at all.
[6/27/24, 4:13:36 PM] Rory Edwards: Moment may have passed but regardless annoyingly I'm probably in London that weekend, if other folk want to book I might be able to hop on last minute. Only just remembered now my head space has opened up a bit.
[6/27/24, 4:13:43 PM] Fergus Neville: Yeah, hopefully not too bad. Sounds like it was a relief to have it diagnosed though as explained his symptoms and ruled out some ever worse possibilities.
[6/27/24, 4:20:45 PM] Rory Edwards: Yeah as symptoms go they come with a few worries.
[6/27/24, 4:27:04 PM] David Thomas: Sorry Rory, all sounds hugely stressful especially if they put you under for it - but glad you got the more serious stuff ruled out

Speaking of tony hawk I feel this album gives great skate park energy. How did you guys get on with it? The singer and drummer Riley is a pal who also does some excellent jungle DJing

[7/8/24, 11:07:58 AM] Fergus Neville: PSB seemed to be well received last time and they have plenty of great records to explore. I picked them for a Disco theme last time and got attacked for it (Neil?), so let's see if Dave let's me have this as pop. It's pretty dark in places but with some great melodies/beats/lyrics. It was very popular in it's day (alternative mainstream?) and they've definitely been on Top of the Pops so that qualifies imo.

[7/12/24, 8:38:43 AM] Neil Tilston: An early version of the group called Girl's Tyme appeared on "Star Search" ‎<This message was edited>
[7/12/24, 8:38:44 AM] Neil Tilston: 1990–1997: Early beginnings and Girl's Tyme
In 1990, Beyoncé Knowles met LaTavia Roberson at an audition for a girl group.[8] Based in Houston, Texas, they were joined to a group that performed rapping and dancing. Kelly Rowland, who relocated to Knowles' house because of family issues, joined them in 1992. Originally named Girl's Tyme, they were eventually cut down to six members including Támar Davis and sisters Nikki and Nina Taylor.[9][10] With Knowles and Rowland, Girl's Tyme attracted nationwide attention:[9] west-coast R&B producer Arne Frager flew to Houston to see them. He brought them to his studio, The Plant Recording Studios, in Northern California, with focus on Knowles' vocals because Frager thought she had personality and the ability to sing.[9] With efforts to sign Girl's Tyme to a major record deal, Frager's strategy was to debut the group in Star Search, the biggest talent show on national TV at the time.[9] However, they lost the competition because, according to Knowles, their choice of song was wrong;[11] they were actually rapping instead of singing.[8]

[7/12/24, 9:20:05 AM] Fergus Neville: Yeah, Harry Styles was better than I was expecting. I had feared some bombastic crooning with tinny production, but it was far more refined than that. Not something I'll necessarily be reaching for again, but I wouldn't rush to turn it off.
[7/12/24, 9:24:50 AM] David Thomas: He has a couple of singles on each album that are standouts, get played on the local indie radio, but I was super impressed with the overall production of the album, low key Bombay bicycle club vibes
[7/12/24, 9:26:05 AM] Fergus Neville: Turns out he was in One Direction. I thought it was Busted.

[7/14/24, 12:06:28 PM] Fergus Neville: You can’t moan is the final compulsory track
[7/14/24, 12:06:35 PM] Fergus Neville: So do I!
[7/14/24, 12:07:48 PM] Neil Tilston: There's some great bonus material on this though. Love that Beatles cover and the quality doesn't dip. I think because my cd included the bonus I never really considered it add on.
[7/14/24, 12:09:01 PM] Neil Tilston: Nobody's twisting your arm and why are you being so reasonable now in particular

*Sees I had headphones on
What are you listening to?
Me - it's a folk punk concept album about the movie space jam with Michael Jordan, Bugs Bunny and Bill Murray
😐

[7/16/24, 5:38:58 PM] Rory Edwards: Definitely an album with a sound rather than any sort of narrative. So low key it's horizontal but I love the detail in the percussion.
[7/16/24, 5:39:26 PM] Rory Edwards: Apparently made by quite a big deal dub producer called Scientist but no idea why you can't find it under his name now.
[7/17/24, 7:13:49 AM] Fergus Neville: I'm intrigued by your bicycle storage solutions. Our bikes are reproducing at an alarming rate and taking over the garage. Are those brackets on the walls to hold them in place?

We’re both working at Thomas Jefferson University

[7/17/24, 9:02:41 AM] Fergus Neville: Physics/maths geeks, is it possible to report the standard error for a standardised regression coefficient? I've reported the standardised coefficients as I'm using different scales, but I only have the standard errors for the unstandardised coefficient and the journal editor is whining about it

[7/17/24, 9:56:04 AM] Fergus Neville: Enjoyed all the records this week 👍
[7/17/24, 9:56:12 AM] Fergus Neville: Feel like I might need to rewatch Space Jam

[7/19/24, 6:43:56 AM] Rory Edwards: It's a 1962 movie I have not seen.
[7/19/24, 6:47:30 AM] Fergus Neville: Some of us did raise the marketing issue of promoting an unpronouncable event, but the Forgan Arts Centre love their pagan festivals (which is why, sadly, it also needs to be on that date)

They tweaked the title as well
[7/19/24, 6:58:20 AM] Neil Tilston: The funky gunners call it the unpronounceable Festival which definitely gives Macbeth/Voldemort vibes
[7/19/24, 7:01:07 AM] Fergus Neville: I'd also thought of this (although not really a banger)

[7/25/24, 4:06:16 PM] Rory Edwards: Very musically accomplished but turbo dark for a sunny evening, her voice always reminds me of Feist's.
[7/25/24, 4:06:55 PM] Rory Edwards: This was ace, cool mix of genres, even sounded a bit Hendrix in places, enjoyed it's complex relationship with nationality.
[7/25/24, 4:08:13 PM] Rory Edwards: I liked bits of this but didn't feel it came together well, cool production throughout but some jarring tone shifts, might be what happens when you have lots of mates.

Any album that you can Photoshop Kamala holding?

[7/29/24, 6:39:28 AM] Rory Edwards: Shall I pick a theme like I should have and give Strims a week to sort himself out? A week ago Biden was still the candidate, a long time in politics etc.
[7/29/24, 6:40:27 AM] Rory Edwards: *Disclaimer - my idea for a theme is bad, decent album to go with it though
[7/29/24, 7:32:19 AM] Rory Edwards: So I felt bad for Josh Tarling over the weekend who missed a time trial medal by two seconds after a puncture and also has to put up with Dave Brailsford at work on a normal day. https://www.google.com/amp/s/metro.co.uk/2024/07/27/team-gb-star-cant-stop-swearing-robbed-olympic-gold-21310421/amp/

[7/29/24, 9:21:17 AM] David Thomas: This is great, cos my pick for a theme was going to be ‘French’ - we can do that next week

[7/31/24, 10:11:34 AM] Rory Edwards: I think he has forgotten where Wales is which is understandable given Gareth Bale has retired. He needs to remember for this theme though.
[7/31/24, 10:11:57 AM] Neil Tilston: He'll probably pick something french again

[7/31/24, 10:46:03 AM] Rory Edwards: I also seem to recall her being about ten things but don't think any of them were Welsh.
[7/31/24, 10:48:01 AM] Fergus Neville: Ah shitebags, really? I know I picked a different one of hers previously.

A neighbour just told me that one of the family befriended Sinead O’Connor and used to bring her here to hang out to escape Dublin. I’ve been visiting for 18 years…how have I only just found this out?!

[8/2/24, 11:48:18 AM] David Thomas: May have been too harsh on this album in hindsight. Very much enjoying it this morning
[8/2/24, 11:49:25 AM] Fergus Neville: Me too - we played it in the car driving to Dublin. I’d say the first half is very strong, then peters out quite dramatically.
[8/2/24, 11:49:43 AM] David Thomas: lol, I’m only half way thru

[8/3/24, 4:57:32 PM] Rory Edwards: Awesome day. 10/10 says Fraser which is a big accolade. Up there with the zoo. Really missed you @⁨Fergus Neville⁩. Would never have happened without you. Will just have to do it again...
[8/3/24, 5:00:10 PM] Rory Edwards: Crazy that the best American garage punk album in years is by a Welsh band. Catches that small town combo of anger/despair and hope just right.
[8/3/24, 5:02:00 PM] Rory Edwards: This showcases a huge range of production styles, particularly like the jazzy bits. Enjoyed most of the sections but doesn't quite hold together for me.
[8/3/24, 5:04:05 PM] Rory Edwards: This on the other hand manages to land the plane, loads of influences, strong lyrical content, mildly insane, A++
[8/3/24, 5:10:22 PM] Rory Edwards: Glad someone else defended this album. I don't think the Stereophonics are all that in hindsight but they definitely made the most of the talent they had. I think they are at their strongest when they are talking about small town life, on this album that often manifests as being enthused (Roll up and shine) or overwhelmed (I stopped to fill my car up) by the bright lights they've discovered. They try to offer that hope to others as well (Pick a part that's new).
[8/3/24, 5:10:56 PM] Rory Edwards: That said they are much too big for their ability and some tunes are a bit silly (Bartender and the thief) while others are just bad.
[8/3/24, 5:11:42 PM] Rory Edwards: Still at least they didn't completely stack it the moment they had a budget like many others have.
[8/3/24, 5:11:52 PM] Rory Edwards: 6/10
[8/4/24, 2:47:32 AM] Neil Tilston: Thanks Rory yesterday was brilliant thanks for coming. Gutted that Fergus wasn't there in body but he was definitely there in spirit and his name was everywhere. We'll never do anything like that without him again I'll make sure of it
[8/4/24, 2:49:35 AM] Neil Tilston: I remember loving these guys debut back in the day. Had them in the same quirky indie pocket as folk like architecture in Helsinki. I'm sure they popped up on my radar again about 10 years ago with a really good record. And here they are again almost 20 years since the debut doing it again. Apparently they're an emo punk band now and a really good one. Can't wait to hear them again in another decade 👍
[8/4/24, 2:51:19 AM] Neil Tilston: It's a cool and interesting record. Didn't expect the closest album to J Dilla's donuts to be made by a Welsh guy of Indian decent but there you go. I guess it's a bit of an album for people who are into this kind of thing but I thought it would be fun to throw in the mix as certainly not a typical Welsh record.
[8/4/24, 2:51:59 AM] Neil Tilston: I owned the poodle rocking single on cd back in the day - bona fide banger. Great band great album. Pick of the week for me as well
[8/4/24, 2:52:53 AM] Neil Tilston: Listening back it was much better than I feared. Think the first half is particularly strong. Some of the songwriting on the second half a bit patchy. Big sound - great in the car in the sun 👍
[8/5/24, 4:54:25 AM] Neil Tilston: Is it me on the theme? Sorry I'm late if so 😬

[8/9/24, 11:29:28 AM] Neil Tilston: Seven baguettes 🤣
[8/9/24, 11:29:39 AM] Fergus Neville: Minus 7 is a savage rating. Even Weezer got 0.

[8/9/24, 11:30:47 AM] Rory Edwards: This is definitely Camille's most French album. It uses a lot of traditional folk and music hall concepts. I love the running theme about photocopying. Still only 7🥖 as often weird and doesn't hold together very well.
[8/9/24, 11:32:33 AM] Rory Edwards: This guy was extremely dull for half an album then found his groove. Production good throughout but loved the more Carribbean bits. Only 6🥖 for being half bad.
[8/9/24, 11:33:41 AM] David Thomas: Excellent reviewing, if an extremely non-linear bread scale
[8/9/24, 11:34:43 AM] Rory Edwards: I like the idea of Edith Piaf - basically a singing french Princess Margaret - a lot more than I like listening to an album of her stuff. 10🥖 for frenchness 2/5 for how much I enjoyed it.

[8/12/24, 3:01:23 AM] Neil Tilston: My instinct is it's probably fine...
[8/12/24, 3:09:11 AM] Fergus Neville: I would say fine
[8/12/24, 3:09:40 AM] Neil Tilston: I think so - we're clearly poking the fun at ourselves
[8/12/24, 3:47:44 AM] Fergus Neville: My turn for a theme I think? Pick a blues album, however you choose to define that.

[8/12/24, 1:46:23 PM] Rory Edwards: I made you aware of it mate but I didn't buy them in the end as couldn't make the gig. Must have been Ferg.
[8/12/24, 1:57:19 PM] Fergus Neville: Aye that was me. Rory made us buy tickets then fucked off.
[8/12/24, 1:57:38 PM] Fergus Neville: Can’t remember if you’ve paid for them or not 🤷‍♂️

[8/13/24, 3:47:01 AM] Rory Edwards: Speaking of systemic discrimination and blues albums. Did you guys hear about the limited edition vinyl album Jack White put out through his record shops? Was disappointed to read today it's now got a proper release which is a weird thing to be disappointed by but hey ho https://www.uncut.co.uk/news/jack-white-confirms-official-release-for-his-no-name-album-146689/
[8/13/24, 3:47:45 AM] Fergus Neville: I love the Black Keys, and that covers album is my favourite
[8/13/24, 3:48:51 AM] Fergus Neville: You do know that’s my pick right?!
[8/13/24, 3:49:39 AM] Fergus Neville: I hadn’t heard the thing about limited release. I like that idea, but I’m please were able to hear it too. Fun throwaway garage blues from the master!
[8/13/24, 4:23:49 AM] Rory Edwards: Ha, no I hadn't looked properly 🤣
[8/13/24, 4:25:15 AM] Rory Edwards: Very much at the point where perspectives on the school holidays in album club switch.
[8/13/24, 6:38:41 AM] Fergus Neville: I hear ya!
[8/13/24, 9:58:54 AM] Fergus Neville: This was fantastic! Will definitely listen again 👍👍
[8/13/24, 10:30:21 AM] Fergus Neville: Actually I was referring to Delta Kream which I've picked before I think and is also Junior Kimbrough covers. I didn't realise they'd done two! A great discovery!
[8/13/24, 9:23:07 PM] David Thomas: relistening to this sitting in my car in a massive thunderstorm - we have a last minute house showing (house is up for sale), so we had to clear out of the house with 15 minutes notice, after we'd been out for happy hour; so i've had 2 beers, and my dogs sitting next to me shivering cos she's afraid of thunder so i can't walk her.  i think this EP is magical - both albert and B.B. are powerful in their own ways (especially that 1st track on the B.B album), but i think both suffer from being succesful in a genre that inherently requires someone to be at their lowest; i don't want to hear a blues song about going out to find women (it always sounds a little creepy/unsettling with hindsight) - i want to hear blues song about loosing your house, or loosing your dog, or your heart - heart ache and longing, not upbeat the joy that BB king aims to leaves you with. I like the flow of the songs - drone-like brooding beat, reminds me of early low fi beck
[8/13/24, 9:24:09 PM] David Thomas: makes me want to listen to more Black Keys
[8/13/24, 9:25:48 PM] David Thomas: LOVE that you got to the new Jack White album from a random shout of 'RACIST' from Ferg
[8/14/24, 2:31:00 AM] Rory Edwards: Extremely "2 beers' reviewing..Great insight though.

[8/14/24, 11:43:20 AM] Fergus Neville: Terrific picks all round this week lads! Thanks for indulging me with blues week. My Jack White was the weakest (still great, but a fun throwaway) compared to your classics. Loved them all.
[8/14/24, 11:43:38 AM] Fergus Neville: Junior Kimbrough is my new favourite artist
[8/14/24, 11:48:13 AM] Fergus Neville: The lad had 36 children! #player
[8/14/24, 12:25:48 PM] Rory Edwards: I really liked Jack's record. Particularly the back end. A bit of a white stripes throwback. I get what you mean about throwaway though. It's not deep but it is good.
[8/14/24, 12:26:07 PM] Rory Edwards: Lots of religious language even for him.
[8/14/24, 12:26:10 PM] Neil Tilston: Agree second half was stronger
[8/14/24, 12:30:52 PM] Rory Edwards: I like this BB record almost because it's short and shallow. A bit of a tour of his music with the jazz and soul I influences hanging out. I like blues but do get a bit fed up of any guitar music where a riff hangs around forever.
[8/14/24, 12:31:05 PM] Rory Edwards: Holy crap what a huge guitar and voice though.
[8/14/24, 1:41:05 PM] David Thomas: Same, thought this was great fun.

Hamish's latest album finds him a bit angrier and a lot hornier than on his previous records.

Great album though.

[8/19/24, 6:17:42 AM] Neil Tilston: Is it just me or is track 2 a much lower volume than track 1 on this?
[8/19/24, 7:24:39 AM] Fergus Neville: Yeah! Maybe just because track 1 is such a banger.
[8/19/24, 9:12:12 AM] David Thomas: This is so so great. Hornier hamish is great. Channelling his inner Jarvis Cocker at times
[8/19/24, 9:15:32 AM] Rory Edwards: Agree it's great. Who isn't feeling angrier and hornier right now while they commodify themselves to make some twats balance sheet go green. Love an album about universal experience. Extreme dark top energy. 5*

[8/20/24, 2:43:21 AM] Fergus Neville: It was good though!
[8/22/24, 3:26:53 PM] Neil Tilston: This is brilliant thinking they're a really ace band. Very jealous that Ewan from Big Rock is getting to see them at Manchester Psych fest.
[8/22/24, 3:27:18 PM] Neil Tilston: EiS never disappoint. The drumming remains spectacularly good.
[8/22/24, 3:28:28 PM] Neil Tilston: I actually found this a bit disappointing sorry. I really liked the single but I was hoping for Pogues like energy and got a slightly twee saw doctors meets the blue tones that underwhelmed

[8/23/24, 3:10:02 AM] Fergus Neville: Possibly although Marc Riley had them in for a session recently! Mind you he’s had Randolph’s Leap in too.
[8/23/24, 3:11:00 AM] Fergus Neville: I saw them support Broken Chanter and Raveloe a few months back. They would have been my pick for the “surprisingly good support act” theme of Dave’s, but they hadn’t released anything at the time.

[8/23/24, 11:27:20 AM] Rory Edwards: Hard agree. Think this is a top tier post rock album. Love a record than can suggest a narrative without a word.
[8/24/24, 4:10:49 AM] Rory Edwards: I also very much enjoyed this. A bit like King Buzzard decided to make a proper album with Kula Shaker. Can't say there are many artists producing rock music with this depth.
[8/24/24, 4:12:04 AM] Rory Edwards: I didn't mind the twee as much as Neil but do think the single is ahead of the record.
[8/24/24, 4:12:36 AM] Rory Edwards: Does @⁨David Thomas⁩ have a single? I have a lot of DIY to do and an underwhelming new theme.
[8/24/24, 4:25:13 AM] Fergus Neville: Agree with this too. Enjoyed it!
[8/24/24, 4:25:42 AM] Fergus Neville: Underwhelming albums doesn’t sound a great theme tbh
[8/24/24, 4:27:57 AM] Rory Edwards: I don't know, being overwhelmed by albums sounds like a lot of work.
[8/24/24, 5:38:49 AM] Fergus Neville: Yeah that’s true. Whelmed is the sweet spot.

[8/24/24, 2:56:22 PM] Rory Edwards: So I've been listening to lots of post rock these last two weeks much to the annoyance of Marie. Enjoying all of the somewhat experimental track lengths and concepts.
[8/24/24, 2:56:33 PM] Rory Edwards: So pick something whelming and somewhat experimental.

[8/27/24, 6:42:12 AM] Rory Edwards: Yeah same, I think they were awesome but I also feel I've kinda done it, particularly at today's gig prices. That said the tickets aren't out yet...
[8/27/24, 6:42:36 AM] Fergus Neville: Yeah, agree with all that
[8/27/24, 6:42:49 AM] Fergus Neville: Let's see how the Murrayfield tickets are priced...
[8/27/24, 6:43:37 AM] Rory Edwards: I reckon the number will start with at least a 7.
[8/27/24, 6:44:46 AM] Rory Edwards: The national were charging £80 in Glasgow a few months back. They are a great show but I have seen them twice, was very easy to say no at that number.
[8/27/24, 6:45:33 AM] Fergus Neville: Agreed. I'm enjoying local DIY shows much more at the momeny (although that being said Magnetic Fields at the festival were a brilliant - if expensive - treat)
[8/27/24, 6:45:56 AM] Fergus Neville: It partly depends on support acts too. Oasis could pull together some pretty great lineups.
[8/27/24, 8:45:00 AM] Neil Tilston: I'd consider for around £50. Pretty sure tickets will be £100+ though so that'll rule me out.
[8/27/24, 8:46:52 AM] Neil Tilston: I saw oasis a couple of times back in the day. Don't think they'd make my top 50 live acts tbh. 

I understand they're a significant band and I've no doubt tickets for this will sell well without me.  I'll give me money to up and coming acts I'm excited about.

[8/28/24, 9:01:15 AM] Rory Edwards: Lolling at the fact Noel Gallagher is your equivalent of Taylor Swift.
[8/28/24, 9:03:20 AM] Rory Edwards: This is batshit but amazing by the way. An experimental, cinematic choral epic, almost musical theatre in places. I really enjoyed it but can't ever see myself listening to it again outside of sitting someone down and forcing them through it as well. ‎<This message was edited>

[8/28/24, 9:20:27 AM] Rory Edwards: Great find. The sort of thing that deserves a bigger audience but if they changed it to give it one it would break.
[8/28/24, 9:21:27 AM] Rory Edwards: That said bits of it have managed to get to get to 3 million listens so there's that.
[8/28/24, 9:23:03 AM] Fergus Neville: 👍
[8/28/24, 11:24:56 AM] Neil Tilston: It didn't save my place 😭
[8/28/24, 12:10:11 PM] Fergus Neville: I'm pausing at 1 hour 54 mins. Just saving that information here so that I don't end up like Neil.
[8/28/24, 12:42:36 PM] David Thomas: I tried a few times over the last couple of days, but the stress of moving whilst camping out in an empty house wasn’t conducive to whatever creepiness this is (didn’t get thru the first few bars mind, so might have mischaracterized it)
[8/28/24, 12:45:16 PM] David Thomas: Looking forward to listening on the flight to Philly

[8/28/24, 12:52:10 PM] David Thomas: Moving in progress!  Got two offers for the house yesterday! Tonnes of viewings all month, but no offers until yesterday. Super pleased to have it go under contract before we get to Philly, and we managed to get them to bid against each other until they gave us $10k less than asking, which was speculative at best
[8/28/24, 12:54:40 PM] David Thomas: We’re renting a house in Philly for 9months, needed to get the kids registered for school start next week and no way we could afford to buy before we sold
[8/28/24, 12:57:08 PM] Fergus Neville: All sounds great. Makes sense to rent for a while to get a feel for the city and where you want to settle

[8/29/24, 6:30:24 AM] Fergus Neville: This is a bit weird isn't it?
[8/29/24, 6:30:55 AM] Fergus Neville: I don't think I've ever sat through an Eno/Byrne album and have meant to for a while. It was cool, but probably rewards further listens.
[8/29/24, 7:05:23 AM] Rory Edwards: I really liked the opening few numbers but felt it lost its way a bit in the middle.
[8/29/24, 7:06:35 AM] Rory Edwards: Liked how it explored different sounds, maybe I just liked the earlier ones more. The 'message' theme is interesting, lots of religious stuff. Not sure where Eno is on that.
[8/29/24, 7:19:53 AM] Neil Tilston: Eno has done a lot of different things

Glam rock -
Here Come the warm jets
Also work with Bowie and Roxy music

Minimalist 
Music for airports and various other ambient things

Art pop
Producing all of talking heads best records

This is definitely on the experimental side (as the theme dictated). It's an album I've listened to a couple of times before and always thought "I bet that rewards repeated listens" but I've never done the work to listen to it enough times (yet). I know it was hugely groundbreaking in how it used samples and the concept of it is super cool. Tbh I prefer Adrian Sherwood's dubby rip off of it he released under African head charge. ‎<This message was edited>
[8/29/24, 7:21:14 AM] Neil Tilston: Give this album a listen: My Life In A Hole In The Ground

[8/29/24, 10:44:19 PM] David Thomas: This is fascinating, listened a bunch of time. LOVED parts of it, hated others - seemed to be deliberately hard to enjoy in places, especially the jarring noise of the first track, whereas when it was good it all just sang together, soared like what I sometimes hope the not so good albums from GSYBE should sound like. Any more explanation of what the hell it’s about?
[8/29/24, 10:45:08 PM] David Thomas: This was a great theme btw, I’m just gonna need a month or two to get through it all
[8/29/24, 10:48:16 PM] David Thomas: My pick might have been the longest, but probably the easiest to listen to. They/ he seem to be aiming for some sort of cross country drive while listening to dueling radio stations, I think I’ve mentioned my love of radio before, so this side of it spoke to me especially - none of the tracks really stand out, but the beauty of it is the flow between different styles and influences, whilst all essentially being the same - feels like the miles are flying by whilst listening, even if I’m stuck at home/work doing something dull.
[8/29/24, 11:02:28 PM] David Thomas: By moving away from Denver we’re giving up our favorite denver radio station - the indie music version of NPR, which has been the soundtrack of our lives the last 8years - car and house - and has exposed the kids to so many awesome influences that neither me nor lorna would have put on - the kids talk about the trans and overly chirpy breakfast host like a extended version fo our family, and can both sing along to Charlie Crocket and 100gecs and Olivia Rodriguez thanks to her - anyway this album felt like a fitting companion to our transition to Philly
[8/29/24, 11:05:20 PM] David Thomas: Fully aware that the lefty enclaves we’ve lived in so far don’t represent the real American radio - that’s something more like that queens of the Stone Age track intro that’s just creepy as fuck rapture radio blending into static ‎<This message was edited>

[8/30/24, 10:11:54 AM] Fergus Neville: This is brilliantly odd
[8/30/24, 11:06:50 AM] David Thomas: Think the theme has to be Oasis then. Pick an Oasis album if you must, but preferably some artist/album that have a backstory with the band.

Whenever folk asked me who did you prefer out of oasis and blur I always got a kick out of saying that Blur weren't even my  favourite band of Damon Alburn . I picked demon days before so here's the trip hoppy debut

[9/2/24, 1:45:58 AM] Neil Tilston: The whole album is like a great homage to 60s psychedelic rock. Think it's really cool how much great electronic music is influenced by that time
[9/2/24, 1:46:39 AM] Neil Tilston: Always amazed how they managed to make Paul Weller sound so cool

[9/2/24, 3:45:33 PM] Fergus Neville: Yes but also music which is why I thought it was acceptable
[9/2/24, 3:45:41 PM] Fergus Neville: You know who FF was right?
[9/2/24, 3:46:05 PM] Fergus Neville: And what happened to him in a car? And why that was bad for him? And Europe?
[9/2/24, 3:47:01 PM] Rory Edwards: I think it's acceptable but niche. I would have had to look up the fact he was assassinated in a car. I thought there was even some debate over where it happened.
[9/2/24, 3:48:25 PM] Rory Edwards: I think I have been there but I can't remember exactly where there was, Sarajevo perhaps.
[9/2/24, 3:51:35 PM] Rory Edwards: Google says I'm right although apparently someone chucked a bomb at him first and all sorts, it does sound worse than waiting for the RAC to be fair.
[9/2/24, 3:52:49 PM] Fergus Neville: Sarajevo is right. It led to the start of World War I (although that probably would’ve happened anyway).
[9/2/24, 3:58:36 PM] Rory Edwards: They did teach me something in politics school I'll have you know.
[9/2/24, 3:59:20 PM] Rory Edwards: I also played a lot of Total War.

[9/2/24, 5:13:04 PM] Rory Edwards: I think it's great as well. An interesting one theme wise, full of hope and dread as various characters consider mortality.
[9/2/24, 5:13:36 PM] Rory Edwards: I always think the title track is what Oasis might have sounded like if they had managed to mature a little more gracefully.

My latest solo mix for Funky Gunners. Lots of album club related tracks here!
[9/11/24, 6:59:07 AM] Fergus Neville: Nice! Will stick it on now.
[9/13/24, 3:17:52 AM] Neil Tilston: Enjoyed all the albums this week
[9/13/24, 3:18:40 AM] Neil Tilston: This is a great Bowie record. The big tracks in particular are amongst his finest but the rest does hold up. Not quite on the level of low and Ziggy imo but still a cracker
[9/13/24, 3:19:38 AM] Neil Tilston: I think Holy Snakes are a really cool band. They have a a lovely blend of rock and soul and very good songwriting. I'm going to be advocating them for big rock a lot over the next year.
[9/13/24, 3:20:49 AM] Neil Tilston: Had the first half of this on while working and was a little underwhelmed. Had the second half on loud while driving and that sounded great. Will only listen to them when driving from now on . Actually prefer them when they turn the bombast down a bit and get a bit weird and meandering
[9/13/24, 3:21:20 AM] Neil Tilston: Both crosses and joke about Jamaica the best tunes for me
[9/13/24, 3:22:13 AM] Neil Tilston: Listened to this loads and saw them live quite a bit back in the day (remember a particularly excellent show at la belle Angelle). Was my favourite listen of the week. It's a gorgeous album
[9/13/24, 3:24:23 AM] Rory Edwards: Agree with this. I find Bowie a little patchy but admire his ambition and the madness plays into the dystopian aesthetic here.
[9/13/24, 3:25:06 AM] Rory Edwards: New to me but a very enjoyable listen despite not being my thing on paper. Love that soulful groove coming through.
[9/13/24, 3:27:12 AM] Rory Edwards: Good Hold Steady all sounds similar and covers a lot of the same ground. 'Being in a band' and small town meta commentary, always dripping in religious guilt and epic keyboard lines. Good job that similar sound is really good. ‎<This message was edited>
[9/13/24, 3:30:57 AM] Rory Edwards: Here, here. Only 30,000 ish Spotify listens for this is a crime imo. They have an excellent sense of rhythm and composition. A wide range of instruments is used sparsely but to great effect. The result is quite stirring, tender songs about unrequited love divided by dark and earie dreamscapes. We saw them in Aberdeen and they were great.
[9/13/24, 3:31:39 AM] Rory Edwards: They reformed for a gig last year if Big Rock ever thought about calling them, not sure if they are making new music though.

The Scottish Album of the year award's longlist https://www.sayaward.com/ came out yesterday and the big rock team were super chuffed that three big rock alumni made the list! You may have seen our post on social media. The panel whittles down the longlist from a huge list of nominations (https://www.sayaward.com/eligible) and has been running for 13 years now (https://www.sayaward.com/history). 

Pick any album associated with the award.

[9/16/24, 5:40:12 AM] Neil Tilston: I like him he's in the same wheelhouse as Andrew Wasylyk imo. Picked up a different album of his at that Assai warehouse clearout the other week.
[9/16/24, 5:40:43 AM] Neil Tilston: Alluvium is the one I got on vinyl
[9/17/24, 8:42:51 AM] Fergus Neville: You're right - I enjoyed this very much!
[9/17/24, 8:43:22 AM] Neil Tilston: I thought it was great as well 👍👍
[9/17/24, 9:40:19 AM] Fergus Neville: Still waiting on a @⁨David Thomas⁩ album I think?
[9/17/24, 9:42:00 AM] David Thomas: Sorry. - currently in faculty orientation hell. Ice breakers and group activities.
[9/17/24, 9:42:30 AM] David Thomas: Any handy lists of Scottish album of the year condentors out there?

[9/17/24, 9:48:30 AM] Fergus Neville: The judges will be panicking this year without a Young Fathers album to give it to
[9/17/24, 10:04:47 AM] Fergus Neville: Don't see Diddy on that list I'm afraid Dave if you were hoping to pick him
[9/17/24, 10:20:56 AM] David Thomas: I spy a Calvin Harris album tho

[9/19/24, 11:56:34 AM] Fergus Neville: This is incredible! I mean it's not been conducive to a productive working environment, but totally worth it.
[9/19/24, 11:57:57 AM] Fergus Neville: Bonus points for the track names.
[9/19/24, 11:58:32 AM] David Thomas: "Tom Cruise Runs" the new "Tony Hawk"
[9/19/24, 12:00:22 PM] Fergus Neville: Yes! My favourite too.
[9/19/24, 12:01:18 PM] Fergus Neville: Reminded me a bit of Blanck Mass who I picked years ago to a mixed reception

[9/19/24, 8:59:31 PM] David Thomas: This made my day
[9/20/24, 2:07:20 AM] Rory Edwards: This is very good. Reminded me a bit of both Jenny Lewis and Civil Wars. Particularly the last tune that was quite the tone shift.
[9/20/24, 2:10:36 AM] Rory Edwards: Glad others enjoyed this. A ghost pining of his dead relationship while realising he'll kill the next one too. Surprisingly cheery as he comes to acceptance. With going back through their stuff as they made quite a bit of good music. Think they're active again too.
[9/20/24, 2:18:23 AM] Rory Edwards: This started off a bit elevator music for me then grew on me by track three which could be called God doesn't exist. The artist then seems to have some sort of encounter with a lover/saviour figure and goes off the deep end a bit, much improving the album.
[9/20/24, 2:19:16 AM] Rory Edwards: Both my kids desperately have asked me to switch this off which is not a good sign. Will listen on my run today.
[9/20/24, 2:29:57 AM] Neil Tilston: Good reviews rory
[9/20/24, 2:30:13 AM] Neil Tilston: Free choice on the singles/bangers
[9/20/24, 2:49:27 AM] Neil Tilston: This project is insane

The music is wild 

I love it
[9/20/24, 2:51:11 AM] Neil Tilston: Really enjoyed this it's far more uplifting and euphoric than the more recent stuff. Cracker ‎<This message was edited>
[9/20/24, 2:52:00 AM] Neil Tilston: I'm still not completely won over by this tbh. It's not bad but I don't really get it yet I think. Might need more listens.
[9/20/24, 2:52:32 AM] Neil Tilston: My favourite of the week. Just the right amount of weird to intrigue. Really great songs. Will revisit
[9/20/24, 3:00:44 AM] Neil Tilston: Anyone know her other albums?  I'm aware (or at least recognise the cover art) of FIBS and Varmints. Are those good? What should I listen to first?

This fab cover of baby Huey from former SAY nominees Camera Obscura came out today. I loved this when they played it on a. Radio session I listened to- delighted it's got a proper release.
[9/20/24, 3:20:00 AM] Neil Tilston: I've actually listened now and it's not the cover I heard before! It's a demo of the track from their album about baby Huey. Still good though!

[9/20/24, 6:37:39 AM] David Thomas: Somewhat stressful week here with house selling gubins (buyers missed a 10pm deadline last night, and then sent us a new contract to sign for less money at 10:01pm, knowing we’d sign it - our agent told them to go fuck themselves, so they signed the original contract) - but thankfully we’re all back to swim in dollars like $crooge Mcduck at the end of the month. Anyway - this new PSB ep has been keeping me somewhat sane all week
[9/20/24, 6:51:14 AM] David Thomas: Anyone seen this yet? https://x.com/historic_ally/status/1836834083881844771?s=46
[9/20/24, 6:54:02 AM] Neil Tilston: I saw it the other day
[9/20/24, 6:56:47 AM] Fergus Neville: Urgh, house transactions are stressful enough without that guff. Well done in holding out. BTW do you get a Presidential vote in Pennsylvania? The whole election might come down to 2 votes there...
[9/20/24, 6:58:08 AM] David Thomas: We had no part in it - we were all up for giving in to the terrorists, the idea of starting all over again for $2k made me want vomit - but I guess our agent knows what she’s doing
[9/20/24, 6:58:49 AM] Rory Edwards: Yeah that is very much what you're paying her for.
[9/20/24, 6:59:21 AM] Rory Edwards: Great job by her imo as loads of agents would have just passed the decision on.
[9/20/24, 7:00:18 AM] Fergus Neville: It's an art installation from Duncan and Jordantone. Apparently Massive Attack have been selling t-shirts with the same image.
[9/20/24, 7:00:31 AM] David Thomas: She’s very smug about it
[9/20/24, 7:00:43 AM] David Thomas: What’s the joke? That’s wham right?
[9/20/24, 7:01:13 AM] Fergus Neville: They were Greek immigrants (or at least George Michael or his family were I think)

[9/20/24, 1:33:57 PM] Rory Edwards: This is the best album of spooky fairground music I've ever heard. Nonsense on many levels but hauntingly beautiful on others. Can't even exactly tell you what I think about it, A++, will never listen again.
[9/20/24, 1:35:34 PM] Rory Edwards: So midi it very much reminded me of Uematsu who is lead composer for Final Fantasy. https://open.spotify.com/track/6HHWxdvHoVaLvPL84v5x7I?si=PzlSTecjSxu0l9101T5dsA&context=spotify%3Aalbum%3A2x9uZkJTGLxXHDm8rztQGK ‎<This message was edited>

This is a total rip off of the strokes right?
[9/23/24, 5:39:41 PM] David Thomas: been driving around for work a bunch today, so got to hear the local npr music station playing 75 springsteen songs back to back for the boss' 75th birthday, absolutely unhinged behaviour
[9/23/24, 5:39:43 PM] David Thomas: https://xpn.org/wxpn-playlists/
[9/26/24, 5:16:34 AM] Neil Tilston: Enjoyed revisiting this. The lyrics are a bit "lads lads lads" at times but otherwise fun. I must have listened loads at the time as I remembered every note.
[9/26/24, 5:18:27 AM] Rory Edwards: It's never been a classic for me overall but they sure know how to sling a hook. Some great moments. Enjoyed listening back as well.
[9/26/24, 5:20:56 AM] Fergus Neville: Glad you enjoyed it. Similar experience for me - knew every note and the Riverboat riff was in my head the rest of the day. A bit dated in places, but still a fun and nostalgic listen back.
[9/26/24, 5:21:47 AM] Fergus Neville: Similar review for the Cooper Temple Clause in a way...it was better than I thought it would be, but not as good as I thought it was when the record first came out!
[9/26/24, 5:22:07 AM] Fergus Neville: Singles are massive tunes and lots of fun, but a bit of filler in between
[9/26/24, 5:22:45 AM] Fergus Neville: Commendable Liam Gallagher impression from the vocalist throughout, but without ever actually being LG
[9/26/24, 5:26:18 AM] Fergus Neville: Only The Spinto Band left...a throwback to a band I've never heard of I don't think!
[9/26/24, 5:33:04 AM] Neil Tilston: I'd never heard two of the albums before!

[9/26/24, 9:11:29 AM] David Thomas: Call yourselves indie heads?
[9/26/24, 9:14:44 AM] Rory Edwards: Just for the record I consider this a bit of a masterpiece of american garage rock. Emotional small town stories that squeeze absolutely every bit of melody out of limited kit. There is also a really sweet transition between Twin Falls (my favourite tune) and Some.
[9/26/24, 9:14:53 AM] Rory Edwards: That said I did forget about it for a decade.
[9/26/24, 9:16:45 AM] Rory Edwards: Was clearly too young/daft to appreciate this outside of the single  at the time. Thought it was class on re listening, like a filthy Artic Monkeys. Loads of depth. Just enough in the lyrics. Think it throbs rather than slaps.
[9/26/24, 9:30:22 AM] David Thomas: Hated this when it came out, and for many years later, as it was in everywhere in the late 90s/early 2000s. Glad to see I still feel the same way - it’s dirgy and a chore to get thru. never understood why it was so popular when I was 14, and still don’t like this boring dad rock now. Not an ounce of fun in the tunes nor the lyrics. Give me 30mins of the super grass or the coral any day instead of an hour of this faux soul/funk garbage. Day we caught the train bangs tho
[9/26/24, 9:32:59 AM] David Thomas: Gonna go listen to ‘Spiders’ by Space to cheer myself up
[9/26/24, 10:27:41 AM] Fergus Neville: Oi, easy on the collateral damage! I know who Built to Spill are FFS!
[9/26/24, 10:29:05 AM] Fergus Neville: Agree with you on Supergrass and The Coral tbf
[9/26/24, 10:29:32 AM] Rory Edwards: Both those bands are miles better than OCS for me.
[9/26/24, 10:55:48 AM] Neil Tilston: Agree I'd place them 100 miles higher
[9/26/24, 11:22:50 AM] Fergus Neville: @⁨David Thomas⁩ our old pal Greenhouse Ben once declared to me that OCS were his favourite band. It was a terrible choice, but I respected the gutsiness of the admission.

How about albums that soundtracked big moments in your life? Old or new, big at the time or in hindsight fit the moment ‎<This message was edited>

[9/28/24, 2:49:05 AM] Fergus Neville: Hope all is going well for you in Philly 👍
[9/28/24, 3:50:22 AM] Rory Edwards: Great theme choice. Will.be interesting to hear what was going on at the time.
[9/28/24, 3:52:36 AM] Rory Edwards: Didn't review this which is a shame as I thought it was really good. Only encountered them sporadically at the time but think they have a deep melodic sound. A little twee in the B&S/Neutral Milk mouod.but none the worse for it. Cover art is also ace.
[9/28/24, 3:54:37 AM] Fergus Neville: My sister Lucy saw Frightened Rabbit launch this album at an instore gig and posted a signed copy to us. It arrived when Aoife was born, and it was in the the car’s CD player for the several days I spent driving to/from the hospital for visits. So I very much associate this album with that happy (but stressful!) time.

[9/28/24, 4:13:41 AM] Rory Edwards: I'll save my comments about this record for the review but know it well.
[9/28/24, 4:16:08 AM] Rory Edwards: There is chatter about a memorial bench in SQ which I would sit on. I think it's been just long enough now that it's back to being listenable for me, although Portrait of a Panic Attack might still be a battle.
[9/28/24, 4:27:30 AM] Neil Tilston: There were a couple of Scottish bands with very heavy lyrics that everyone else loved but never did it for me. Frightened Rabbit and Twilight Sad. That said I will of course listen with an open mind. And, given the circumstances around Scott's death I certainly won't indulge in any kind of joyous panning. Grant was at our Lughnasadh festival selling cider and was a lovely guy.
[9/28/24, 4:27:53 AM] Neil Tilston: What is SQ?
[9/28/24, 4:28:32 AM] Rory Edwards: South Queensferry.
[9/28/24, 4:28:52 AM] Neil Tilston: Of course sorry I was incorrectly assuming Scottish something
[9/28/24, 4:30:49 AM] Rory Edwards: Hadn't realised I may have bought cider off Grant.
[9/28/24, 4:31:24 AM] Rory Edwards: Never like Twilight Sad really so interesting to hear they're in a similar bracket for you.
[9/28/24, 4:48:32 AM] Neil Tilston: They have some things in common. Both Scottish indie popular around 2010 with heavy subject matters in lyrics. And it felt like people with similar taste to me were into them but I never really got it
[9/28/24, 5:32:28 AM] Fergus Neville: Same for me! Loved FR but never really got TS.
[9/28/24, 5:32:59 AM] Neil Tilston: Somebody must have liked Twilight Sad!

[10/3/24, 4:35:52 AM] Rory Edwards: It's actually easier as you only have to remember the notes of one song. Despite having a weakness for the genre I found this a bit of a slog I'm afraid. Opener is a banger. ‎<This message was edited>
[10/3/24, 4:36:19 AM] Rory Edwards: Some may find this useful/enjoy https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2024/oct/03/im-travelling-to-every-record-shop-in-the-uk-here-are-my-10-favourites
[10/3/24, 4:45:24 AM] Rory Edwards: I like Frightened Rabbit. Think this album showcases both their strengths and their flaws well. They sling a great hook and keep tunes ticking along but don't have huge variety within those, although Nitrous Gas on this is a successful departure from their main formula for me. The lyrics are the draw and are at their best when they are a little tongue in cheek and offer a glimmer of hope amidst the misery, Backyard Skulls with their grins and the rise at the end of Oil Slick both great examples of this on here, I'm Dead a total dirge.
[10/3/24, 4:49:32 AM] Rory Edwards: A good band, not a great one, a wee bit ruined for me by what happened. Scott a huge talent but very sure about himself on a lot of things and I rarely find folk like that to be very happy.
[10/3/24, 1:24:13 PM] Neil Tilston: I think I just don't really like the whole stomp clap indie genre that was so big and in my head this belongs to. Struggle to hear much beyond a Scottish accent to separate it from the likes of Limineers, Mumford and sons, of Monster and Men etc.
[10/3/24, 1:24:42 PM] Neil Tilston: Have to agree with Rory. Private Eye a total banger but not an album band imo
[10/3/24, 1:25:34 PM] Neil Tilston: My favourite of the week and very possibly my favourite album of theirs. Exciting, relentless, right on the edge. Love it ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
[10/3/24, 1:27:19 PM] Neil Tilston: Think this is my favourite Emma Pollock solo album. Some lovely pop in their but also some unusual stuff that showcases her range well. Also features David McAuley who would go on to grace the Big Rock Rio stage with Afterlands!

Interested to hear if you guys liked it.
[10/3/24, 1:29:38 PM] Rory Edwards: Maybe you should take up swearing at church. I've heard that puts the brakes on it.
[10/3/24, 1:30:52 PM] Rory Edwards: I really enjoyed it and very much liked the board range. Completely new to me. Going to second listen at some point.
[10/3/24, 1:31:56 PM] David Thomas: I’ve heard this genre called ‘imagine wagons’
[10/3/24, 1:31:59 PM] Rory Edwards: This record showcases their raw phase at its very best for me. A whisker away from perfection in the odd forgettable tune so merely has to be content with being very, very good. Five stars easily.
[10/3/24, 2:04:39 PM] Neil Tilston: I don't understand this sorry. Is it a reference to a lyric?
[10/3/24, 2:08:11 PM] Rory Edwards: "I cursed in church again and the hand claps all fell quiet'. From Death March.

Isn't that these?
[10/5/24, 12:10:26 PM] David Thomas: this is great! super upbeat and catchy - have we had her before on here? I don't recognise her
[10/6/24, 4:00:05 AM] Neil Tilston: I remember I liked a previous album of hers - Woman in the Internet a couple of years ago. She's Irish and I'm fairly sure I first heard her on one of Cillian Murphy's radio shows for 6music. I had planned on picking it for album club but I guess I never did.
[10/6/24, 5:01:41 PM] Neil Tilston: Here's a preview of what the funky gunners are doing on Tuesday

[10/11/24, 7:42:36 AM] Neil Tilston: This is gorgeous. More accessible perhaps than some of their work and non the weaker for it. Outstanding album I expect to listen to it lots in the years to come and definitely going to be one of my favourites this year .

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
[10/11/24, 7:44:19 AM] Neil Tilston: Interested to hear you guys thoughts. For me it's original and staggering in a way I've not felt about something new in a long time.

I can hear shades of influences as diverse as Magnetic Fields, bitches brew era miles Davis, the fall and tom Waits. Also show tunes. Shocking staggering and unique art. Bet some folk will absolutely hate it as well.

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
[10/11/24, 7:45:31 AM] Rory Edwards: I also thought it was brilliant. Provocative track titles worth a mention, not sure if they refer to a specific conflict but they easily could. Very surprising then that the first half of the album is almost euphoric. Like it's sponsored by an arms manufacturer. Tone changes and we get the reality of war in the aftermath of the second half. A+
[10/11/24, 7:45:44 AM] Rory Edwards: Loved this and will type.more on it later.
[10/11/24, 7:46:28 AM] Neil Tilston: This is really great as well! (Some week for album club!). At times she has the lyric cal cutting edge and excellent songwriting of fetch the bolt cutter era Fiona apple. Other times it has the swagger of Billy Nomates at her best. Quality stuff. Maybe one or two slightly weaker tracks in the second half means it's not quite 5 stars but still one of the best albums I've heard this year.
👍👍
[10/11/24, 7:47:25 AM] Neil Tilston: Unfortunately this felt a bit lightweight in comparison. Sorry. It's not bad but didn't have the same impact for me. A few lyrics were quite cool but I'd certainly heard enough by the end of it's shorter run time.
[10/11/24, 7:47:46 AM] Neil Tilston: Pirate ride was fun 👍

[10/11/24, 9:06:06 AM] Fergus Neville: 👍👍
[10/11/24, 9:10:16 AM] Rory Edwards: I really liked this. An incredibly ambitious and pitch black orchestral jazz album, just the right side of insane. Rhythm section so tight, up there with the very best.
[10/11/24, 9:10:32 AM] Rory Edwards: Akin to musical theatre in places - 'Holy, holy' which I had heard before sounds like the intro music for Herod in a reimagined Jesus Christ superstar.
[10/11/24, 9:11:12 AM] Rory Edwards: Verbose lyrically majoring on death and religious purity. Will take a few listens to get in deeper.
[10/11/24, 9:40:40 AM] Rory Edwards: High art which will no doubt not find a massive audience. Reckon it will split people. ‎<This message was edited>
[10/11/24, 9:42:28 AM] David Thomas: Less enamored with Geordie Greep than the rest of yous - definitely interesting and different, but didn’t find there to be much substance or thread in the album, got a bit lost tbh
[10/11/24, 9:48:57 AM] Rory Edwards: Glad others enjoyed this. Agree with views so far. On the meatier side of pop lyrically with some amazing turns of phrase. Good range of styles while holding together. Had the hallmarks of the internet game that made her. A bit like an Olivia Rodrigo who has decided to blame herself.
[10/11/24, 9:50:34 AM] Rory Edwards: Still to do this one unfortunately. Pre half term rush here.

[10/17/24, 6:24:06 AM] Neil Tilston: Good start to the Halloween season. Certainly an interesting and influential record that I wasn't aware of before so a good pick. Tbh I only thought one or two tracks were good but I still enjoyed it from a curiousity point of view so it gets the thumbs up 😀
[10/17/24, 6:25:29 AM] Neil Tilston: Loved this one. Obviously know Dizzy ( he was on the Jazzmatazz record) but this album was new to me and an excellent listen on a morning stroll around Venice 👍👍
[10/17/24, 6:26:26 AM] Neil Tilston: This was cool. I'd heard one or two tracks before but not the whole thing. Good to balance out my English blue eyed blues record with something from the original art form 👌
[10/17/24, 10:45:20 AM] Fergus Neville: I enjoyed this also, although I did find it a bit exhausting (as I do with a lot of face-paced jazz). Would sound great in a smokey basement club.
[10/17/24, 2:25:06 PM] Rory Edwards: It's 100 kph, big brass sound. Meant to be one of the first records to introduce Latin sounds to jazz which you can hear in the percussion. Glad folk enjoyed it
[10/17/24, 2:27:23 PM] Rory Edwards: Wish he had had to do this one modern kit, the depth of sound some achievement on what he was working with. Flags up how true to the roots of the genre people like the white stripes are.
[10/18/24, 2:59:02 AM] Rory Edwards: Loving all the Philly photos but this one takes the cake. So glad you guys are settling in well.
[10/18/24, 3:00:28 AM] Rory Edwards: Extremely Dave album. Strong novelty value but seems to take itself fairly seriously and can hold a turn when it wants to
[10/18/24, 3:03:28 AM] Rory Edwards: Clapton's guitar all over this one. Very slick bluesy record. Enjoyed it a lot but not about enough to be a classic for me, really interesting rhythm work throughout which probably influenced Bonham.

[10/18/24, 7:51:41 AM] David Thomas: Had this lined up from 1400BC - https://open.spotify.com/track/4TO5chEVULiyd3o0F7mHp0?si=bMOUxYDRQLe29Q_12p79gA&context=spotify%3Aalbum%3A21ZGIVBBauK84ohjOHeLnb
[10/18/24, 7:58:43 AM] Neil Tilston: Wish hey had had to do this one modern kit, the depth of sound some achievement on what they was working with. 😜
[10/18/24, 7:59:27 AM] Neil Tilston: Incredible to think they had recording studios at all
[10/18/24, 7:59:29 AM] David Thomas: Fergs about to pop up with a balaclava and the original tablet
[10/18/24, 8:04:13 AM] Fergus Neville: At work just now, give me a few hours
[10/18/24, 8:34:19 AM] Rory Edwards: It will be a stone tablet written by a deity with a huge beard.
[10/18/24, 11:37:20 AM] Fergus Neville: Or I could go with another perspective of the beginning of time...

[10/22/24, 10:27:31 AM] David Thomas: Sounds like harlecore
[10/22/24, 2:57:55 PM] David Thomas: this is delightfully weird, really rich and lovely sounding
[10/22/24, 3:01:22 PM] Rory Edwards: I liked this too. At the start I felt it a bit lightweight and I kept expecting a canned radio one jingle to kick in and declare it Friday night, before going to a vox pop of someone called Emma going out in Croydon He has an extra edge of quality though and it grew on me more and more as it went on. Really cool throwback mix.
[10/22/24, 3:01:56 PM] David Thomas: the start was my favorite bit by far
[10/22/24, 3:02:16 PM] David Thomas: you guys are spoiled with your vox pops by emma from croyden
[10/22/24, 3:30:57 PM] Rory Edwards: Thought this was ace. Alt country Black Keys. I know it's not a popular opinion but I find them a little one note. Preferred this lot. Will definitely be listening back.
[10/22/24, 3:32:21 PM] Rory Edwards: Glad you found this suitably uncategorisable. Celtic, choral ponderings on death, a bit Kate Bush in places, I think it's really good but maybe lacks a certain something that holds it all together.
[10/22/24, 3:47:56 PM] Fergus Neville: You’re all very keen this week. I’ve just finished Dave’s premature Halloween nonsense from last time.
[10/22/24, 3:48:19 PM] David Thomas: It only get worse from here Ferg
[10/22/24, 3:48:33 PM] Fergus Neville: Zombina 🤞
[10/24/24, 4:23:50 AM] Fergus Neville: Someones been listening to Kills records...which is obviously a good thing
[10/24/24, 4:26:46 AM] Neil Tilston: Agree it's like the Kills with more choruses
[10/24/24, 4:29:47 AM] Rory Edwards: While this is more Artic Monkeys but with better songs 😜
[10/24/24, 4:32:52 AM] Fergus Neville: Fontaines just toured with the AMs, and said in an interview that they want to replicate their career trajectory by evolving, making interesting music, and "not becoming dickheads"
[10/24/24, 4:33:53 AM] Fergus Neville: Also, by typing the above I've just realised why Arctic Monkeys called one of their albums "AM" 😳
[10/24/24, 4:54:35 AM] Rory Edwards: I really liked the record, loads of great tunes, particularly the singles and the closer. I do think it was slightly lacking that golden thread that tied everything together. From the lyrics of the opener I was expecting a love story about Dublin and it did have a bit of that.
[10/24/24, 4:54:55 AM] Rory Edwards: Still a record full of really good songs is a record full of really good songs.
[10/24/24, 5:01:22 AM] Neil Tilston: Yeah I like that Fontaine's are changing up on each album. The first remains my favourite. This is probably third in my own ranking after skinny FIA. But a cool record anyway

[10/25/24, 7:47:47 AM] David Thomas: This fucks tho. First Tall Paul track on AC?
[10/25/24, 7:48:04 AM] Fergus Neville: It refers to one of the highlights of Album Club in which Rory "I can understand and analyse lyrics" Edwards misheard a Redolent lyric with hilarious consequences
[10/25/24, 7:50:01 AM] Neil Tilston: Ravy dykes = slang for Ravelston Dykes, a geographical location in redolent's native area (very close to Rory's house). Not a sikh lesbian 😄
[10/25/24, 7:50:20 AM] David Thomas: Ah yeah now I remember
[10/25/24, 7:50:31 AM] Rory Edwards: You need to get your own lyrical house in order Neville. Who can forget that time you posted a tune in which a creepy professor outlined exactly how his students could get better grades.

[10/28/24, 4:01:50 AM] Rory Edwards: Rand out of Halloween albums long ago so time for something vaguely theme related. Vaguely can't believe we haven't had this, he's had a big return to form these last few years as well. Give this album a listen: Ladies and gentlemen we are floating in space

Exorcist innit ‎<This message was edited>
[10/30/24, 7:23:19 AM] Neil Tilston: I'd actually planned to pick it for album club Halloween this year but you Gazumped me!
[10/30/24, 7:23:57 AM] Fergus Neville: Yeah I chose it a while back
[10/30/24, 9:47:08 AM] Neil Tilston: Pretty incredible record this. Don't know why I've not listened much before. Could be 5 stars!
[10/30/24, 11:21:17 AM] Rory Edwards: I would say so. Reckon it's a bit of a masterpiece to be honest. Managed to capture both the euphoria and lonely, day-to-day tedium of addiction against a really layered and rich musical backdrop.
[10/30/24, 11:21:46 AM] Rory Edwards: If I was giving it a score out of ten it would be 9.5 though as the 17 min final track is a bit much.
[10/30/24, 11:44:53 AM] Neil Tilston: I loved it! Bluesy swampy gorgeousness
[10/30/24, 12:33:05 PM] Neil Tilston: This is fun but at 29 minutes it's too long! 5 tracks was plenty. #shouldabeenanep
[10/31/24, 7:43:33 AM] Fergus Neville: I really enjoyed it too. Spiritualized have always been a band I'm vaguely aware of and enjoyed on the radio but never properly listened to. Great pick (even if I don't understand the connection to the theme)!
[10/31/24, 7:45:03 AM] Rory Edwards: It's the most Spiritualised night of the year.
[10/31/24, 7:45:20 AM] Fergus Neville: Ahhhhh
[10/31/24, 7:45:23 AM] Fergus Neville: Very good
[10/31/24, 7:47:50 AM] Rory Edwards: Afraid I found this a bit of a slog although it did have some highlights. Zombie is a generational tune up there with the very best of Irish music ever. O'Riordan's voice really special as well.
[10/31/24, 7:49:58 AM] Rory Edwards: Felt I understood why people are in to this band a bit better after this listen. Awesome drum and guitar work in pmaces. Zeppelin esque in places. Particularly enjoyed the opener. Ozzie's vocal the weak bit imo, although it is very distinctive and he seems like some showman.
[10/31/24, 7:50:54 AM] Rory Edwards: Agree entirely with Neil's review on this. Good fun but got a bit thin by the end.
[10/31/24, 7:56:40 AM] Neil Tilston: Not got to it yet but from memory everybody else is doing it is the better album
[10/31/24, 8:47:42 AM] David Thomas: Hard agree
[10/31/24, 9:58:45 AM] David Thomas: I know I’m supposed to like this, and was supposed to like it when I heard it the first time, but it just doesn’t resonate with me for some reason. They don’t have the punch of primal scream, nor the fun of LCD, or the power of the beta band, or the inventiveness of granddaddy. I want to like it more than I do, and it’s not that it’s not good, I just get bored of it
[10/31/24, 10:00:15 AM] David Thomas: Fully aware I’m in the minority, as this is widely celebrated. But I think the dandy worholes made a better version of this album

[10/31/24, 3:54:05 PM] Neil Tilston: I've listened now and would like to defend it a bit more than I did. The title track at the end is particularly haunting and beautiful. Delores voice as you say is stunning and with it she manages to meld all kinds of Irish music (Inc pub trad and sean-nos) with the style the band produces of that lovely FM friendly alt rock that was so strong in the 90s. It's a great record ❤️ ‎<This message was edited>
[10/31/24, 4:47:10 PM] Fergus Neville: I didn’t know it that well but I really enjoyed it too. Quite a hard listen at times but enjoyable throughout and I recognised more than I thought I would. Zombie a masterpiece obviously.

[11/1/24, 1:18:56 PM] Neil Tilston: I checked we had evil empire year one and renegades more recently

[11/1/24, 4:07:55 PM] Neil Tilston: We've been invited to do one of these streams further down the road
[11/1/24, 4:08:22 PM] Neil Tilston: Think there's a few bigger names ahead of us in the queue but hopefully we'll get a turn at some point
[11/1/24, 4:08:53 PM] Neil Tilston: We've also been invited (again at a date tbc) to come one night and they'll show us how to use the digital kit

[11/1/24, 6:28:25 PM] Rory Edwards: Some serious players on this record. Mostly before they all got turbo famous. Sleeve had a note on it saying 'This must be played at maximum volume whatever phonograph you use. Makes very appropriate background music if you have Vicar over for tea."
[11/1/24, 6:28:52 PM] Rory Edwards: I ain't Superstitious the real last track .

[11/2/24, 4:38:51 AM] Neil Tilston: Very much enjoying this. Fake drop on Dol Oro was fun !
[11/2/24, 4:54:43 AM] Fergus Neville: Yeah it’s a belter. Birth4000 is a monster tune also.

[11/4/24, 3:26:02 AM] Neil Tilston: Quincy Jones died
[11/4/24, 8:23:08 AM] David Thomas: Took me a few tries to get into this one, it’s a slow burn, but loving it now. Got it up loud on my big headphones on the train, and it sounds fantastic

‎[11/6/24, 3:27:32 PM] Neil Tilston: ‎image omitted
[11/8/24, 10:48:47 AM] Rory Edwards: Sorry I've been pretty absent this last week or so. Work has been busy, kids have been taking turns to be sick and we're moving house while they knock big holes in ours
[11/8/24, 10:49:16 AM] Rory Edwards: Gig looked ace, sorry to miss it. Election sucked, sorry you had to witness it @⁨David Thomas⁩.
[11/8/24, 10:49:49 AM] Rory Edwards: This was very good. Great and grew as it went on. Reminded me of Bicep.
[11/8/24, 10:51:35 AM] Rory Edwards: This is a superlatively amazing album. I sometimes moan that Rage sound samey but there is huge range on this first record. Time signatures being cut to ribbons all over the place, a rare personal moment on Settle for Nothing, a huge vocal and one of the worlds great guitar players. A++++
[11/8/24, 10:53:10 AM] Rory Edwards: This more a collection of tunes than something cohesive which is maybe what you get with so many artists on staff. They are good tunes though.
[11/8/24, 10:54:15 AM] Rory Edwards: The list of players something else. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_(Jeff_Beck_album)
[11/8/24, 10:55:28 AM] Rory Edwards: I actually think the drums really shine. Although Jimmy Paige only played a bit on it apparently he was there a lot and I reckon you can hear Zeppelins early sound.
[11/8/24, 10:56:57 AM] Rory Edwards: This was largely complete nonsense but I loved it. So much talent to make something at least somewhat tongue and cheek, deep and rich though. Particularly like the first Message.
[11/8/24, 11:34:31 AM] David Thomas: I think it’s great, but actually find myself liking the intergalactic evil Pink Floyd stuff more than the death metal. It kinda works I think? Or maybe it doesn’t work at all
[11/8/24, 11:37:27 AM] Rory Edwards: The death metal bits are my least favourite to be honest. I think if they had chucked the death metal voice it would have been legit very good rather than good amusement with some substance.
[11/8/24, 11:41:11 AM] Fergus Neville: Free choice bangers today btw to suit whatever is your mood
[11/8/24, 11:41:21 AM] Fergus Neville: I'm feeling uninspired but will pick something soon!
[11/8/24, 11:42:21 AM] David Thomas: So don’t think I told you guys this, but one of my gig buddy’s  from work in denver killed himself about a week after we moved from denver. Super sad story (left behind a toddler and his wife with a massive mortgage on a brand new house). I just went to text the link to him - he would have LOVED this.
[11/8/24, 11:48:20 AM] Rory Edwards: That's horrible mate. I'm so sorry to hear.
[11/8/24, 11:56:46 AM] Fergus Neville: That's horrendous. So sorry to hear that Dave.

[11/9/24, 7:24:02 AM] Neil Tilston: The wedding was on Tuesday but they kept the accommodation till Sunday. Family went home on Thursday and a bunch of us have joined them for the weekend
[11/9/24, 7:24:20 AM] Neil Tilston: Everyone else is in the main house and Aine and I ten mins down the drive at the bothy

[11/11/24, 6:05:15 AM] Rory Edwards: Up there with his very best stuff in my view, and I would put The Glow part 2 in my top ten ever albums.
[11/11/24, 6:05:37 AM] Rory Edwards: Not sure what the other nine would be mind, but definitely that one.

I use these and think they're good for the price. Noise cancelling isn't as good as other headphones but I break headphones too often to justify a higher price ‎<This message was edited>

[11/13/24, 11:48:00 AM] Rory Edwards: I've listened to three totally banging records so far this week. Will say something about my pick in time but ..
[11/13/24, 11:49:35 AM] Rory Edwards: This is full of scuzzy Drum and Bass bangers. Similar philosophy to the Prodigy 'The scum are in charge now, they can't kill us all.' Magic stuff.
[11/13/24, 11:50:47 AM] Rory Edwards: This is class. Lots of borrowed sounds brought together into something new. At its best it's Massive Attack meets The Comet is Coming. A++
[11/13/24, 11:51:12 AM] Rory Edwards: I've not listened to album four yet but @⁨David Thomas⁩ picked it so hope springs eternal and all that.
[11/13/24, 12:21:54 PM] Neil Tilston: Want to see them live in Dundee next year?
[11/13/24, 12:23:58 PM] Neil Tilston: https://www.dundeecity.gov.uk/events/event/33509
[11/13/24, 12:27:01 PM] Rory Edwards: Yeah definitely. I'll check the calendar.
[11/14/24, 6:51:58 AM] David Thomas: Definitely my nerdiest pick in a long while, but they can’t half write a tune.
[11/14/24, 6:52:53 AM] David Thomas: We went to see B&S in denver over the summer, and my friends date was drunk and yelled out in one of the quiet parts “is it me or are they just trying to sound like the Decemberists” and everyone booed her
[11/14/24, 6:54:36 AM] David Thomas: I like to think that Colin Meloy gets bullied by the rest of the twee folk scene, Stuart Murdoch deliberately shoving him in his shoulder when he walks past
[11/14/24, 7:00:25 AM] David Thomas: Two or three of their best ever songs on here, which is much to be admired in a 20year old band, love the horns and the old times piano sounds over songs about death and ruthless capitalism, but get a little bored of the sound by the end. Solid 7/10 tho
[11/14/24, 12:11:58 PM] Fergus Neville: I've been enjoying this to work to Dave. The vocals really remind me of someone I can't quite place...any ideas?! It may be that they actually remind me of the Decemberists who I haven't actually listened to much, and not for years.
[11/14/24, 12:12:30 PM] Neil Tilston: Lads I'm still listening to Rory's pick so haven't got to Decemberists yet
[11/14/24, 12:12:47 PM] Neil Tilston: I started listening on Monday like and I'm about halfway now!😂
[11/14/24, 12:13:10 PM] Fergus Neville: I haven't started Rory's yet...is it a quadruple disc saga?
[11/14/24, 12:13:39 PM] Neil Tilston: Been a bit busy so a bit behind on listening will catch up asap. Accidentally applied for a deputy head teacher job today as well 😮
[11/14/24, 12:13:55 PM] Fergus Neville: Nice! Whereabouts?
[11/14/24, 12:14:17 PM] Neil Tilston: Same school it's an acting post just till Christmas
[11/14/24, 12:14:27 PM] Fergus Neville: Great stuff
[11/14/24, 12:14:38 PM] Neil Tilston: I think it's highly unlikely I get it but throwing my hat in anyway
[11/14/24, 12:15:23 PM] Fergus Neville: To paraphrase Spud, you need to show enough willing to get your benefits, but put in too much effort and you might actually get the fucking job
[11/14/24, 12:15:55 PM] Neil Tilston: Exactly!

[11/15/24, 9:25:12 AM] David Thomas: That sucks man, even tho you called it right. Are you applying for deputy jobs elsewhere too?
[11/15/24, 9:29:41 AM] Neil Tilston: God no. I only applied for this because it was only for 5 weeks .
[11/15/24, 9:30:13 AM] Neil Tilston: Maybe one day but not really what I want to do atm
[11/15/24, 9:30:41 AM] Rory Edwards: There are lots of interesting career options out there... https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/videos/cde7x4wkwnpo
[11/15/24, 12:51:58 PM] David Thomas: Who’s up for a theme?
[11/15/24, 12:59:00 PM] Neil Tilston: Just finished Decemberists btw. It really grew on me. Wasn't in the mood for it at first but feel it got louder darker and better as it progressed. The final epic Joan of arc opus with it's heavy metal bits the highlight 👍🏻
[11/15/24, 1:07:15 PM] Rory Edwards: I endorse this review.
[11/15/24, 2:13:49 PM] Rory Edwards: Interested to hear what folk thought of this? Phil Elverum's albums often veer too far towards high art for me, save his masterpiece The Glow pt. 2 which I found an incredible dark, folky, edgy, emotional journey through loss and depression into rebirth.
[11/15/24, 2:14:17 PM] Rory Edwards: In contrast to that he recently released a record that was just one 40 minute song that didn't change much throughout the run time.
[11/15/24, 2:15:39 PM] Rory Edwards: This was a big return to form for him for me, has his trade mark stripped back folk style, akin to Mountain Goats combined with electronica to build the tension then the emotion comes bursting through as almost black metal.
[11/15/24, 2:16:09 PM] Rory Edwards: Melancholy and wistful as usual, but more hopeful than some previous efforts which were all about death.
[11/15/24, 2:16:28 PM] Rory Edwards: Don't think it touches The Glow but still really enjoyed it personally.
[11/15/24, 2:16:50 PM] Rory Edwards: We're doing comeback albums next week for some reason.
[11/15/24, 2:19:53 PM] Neil Tilston: Hard to evaluate fully. I found it hard work but my opportunities to listen we're broken up and I was distracted so couldn't really give it a fair amount of attention. Will need to revisit at a more suitable time.
[11/15/24, 2:20:58 PM] Rory Edwards: Give this album a listen: We got it from Here... Thank You 4 Your service

[11/15/24, 2:22:23 PM] Rory Edwards: Yeah, it's a bit of a headphones on job and possibly an at least twice one as well. I reckon it will be divisive regardless though. One of the things that made the Glow so good is that it managed to be almost mainstream.
[11/15/24, 2:26:46 PM] David Thomas: Wasn’t for me unfortunately. I enjoyed the microphones record a lot, so was hopeful for this one, but after struggling through starting it over a few times was going to nod along with whoever reviewed it first - “yeah, agree” - was glad that Neil pointed out it was 3 weeks long and I wasn’t just being a lightweight
[11/15/24, 2:35:05 PM] Rory Edwards: Oh well. Maybe my comeback record will work for you 🤣

[11/15/24, 2:47:32 PM] David Thomas: 83y/o Zimmerman basically quit recording albums in the 60s to move to Belgium to avoid the draft. Big Thief found him and got him to record this - big thief’s best contribution to music imho
[11/15/24, 2:47:59 PM] Fergus Neville: Anyone other than Rory enjoy Fat Dog? I think it’s absolutely euphoric nonsense and I’ve been playing it loudly all week.
[11/15/24, 2:49:32 PM] David Thomas: I did! But I kept listening to it at work and it was too distracting. Will listen again with less focus working
[11/15/24, 2:50:18 PM] Rory Edwards: You look up and there is this slug giving out crowns. Very distracting.
[11/15/24, 2:51:42 PM] Rory Edwards: You get to be King of the Slugs though.

One of my favourite albums (MM Food by MF DOOM) is 20 years old. So I made a fun playlist of hip hop songs about food. What did I miss? ‎<This message was edited>
[11/17/24, 8:39:19 AM] Fergus Neville: A bit on the nose maybe, but it’s regarded as one of Elvis’ best performances and came after 8 years without being on tele. I’ll spare you the full 3 discs, so here are the best bits:

[11/18/24, 10:37:18 PM] David Thomas: This is cool as hell
[11/19/24, 5:30:38 AM] Fergus Neville: I can always tell when @⁨Neil Tilston⁩ doesn't like one of my picks because he just chooses the first track for his playlist!
[11/19/24, 5:54:38 AM] Neil Tilston: Not true! My favourite part was the melody of shorter tracks at the beginning and I didn't want a 50 second snippet. Track one includes two short tracks hence my pick!
[11/19/24, 5:54:39 AM] Neil Tilston: No man when Elvis does pure rock n roll he's as a good as anyone vocally and performance wise. Burning love, hound dog etc app sound phenomenal here.
[11/19/24, 5:54:39 AM] Neil Tilston: Not a fan of his more croony stuff though so I don't think I'd ever give an Elvis record 5 stars.
[11/19/24, 6:14:40 AM] Fergus Neville: Agree with all that
[11/19/24, 7:15:01 AM] David Thomas: Last track picked from my album 💪
[11/19/24, 4:13:55 PM] David Thomas: This is great
‎[11/19/24, 4:40:44 PM] Fergus Neville: ‎GIF omitted
[11/21/24, 5:47:34 PM] Neil Tilston: I do like this album and agree it was a great comeback record. But I can't help but be a bit bothered by quite how much acclaim it gets. There's some gr at tracks on it for sure but for me it doesn't get near the level of their first three albums.
[11/21/24, 5:48:07 PM] Neil Tilston: The debut album is second only to de la soul 3 ft high for showcasing that goofy creative fun of the daisy age
[11/21/24, 5:48:29 PM] Neil Tilston: Low end theory is a musical masterpiece with that amazing deep base thread throughout
[11/21/24, 5:49:01 PM] Neil Tilston: And marauders is full of incredible verses with the best bits of the first two records
[11/21/24, 5:49:57 PM] Neil Tilston: The comeback album is great but gets a bit bogged down with all the (sometimes a bit odd) guest spots. And although it has some great tracks it suffers a bit from lack of coherence. Similar to later gorrilaz stuff
[11/22/24, 2:45:42 AM] Neil Tilston: Anyhoo
[11/22/24, 2:45:51 AM] Neil Tilston: Here's a banger that we mustn't call a comeback
[11/22/24, 2:46:15 AM] Neil Tilston: https://open.spotify.com/track/6C7ZgThn6Yan5MTZdAEEFw?si=QLFvb98BTZ-_Kfz-JK_Gcg
[11/22/24, 2:57:26 AM] Rory Edwards: So it's probably my favourite album by them but I heard it first so...
[11/22/24, 2:59:04 AM] Rory Edwards: I imagine the acclaim might be boosted somewhat by what happened after. I liked to think I've got better at acclaim not bothering me too much in terms of my enjoyment (see miss Swift) but then was brought crashing down to earth recently by the furore around a meh live band's reunion doing my head in.
[11/22/24, 3:00:33 AM] Rory Edwards: At least we can agree there is lots to commend it. I really like the wet humour and the understated solidarity and political messages. Most of all though I just like how they manage to be a tribe, with their flows coming together so we'll. Production cool too.
[11/22/24, 3:02:03 AM] Rory Edwards: Enjoyed this a lot. I don't really like crooning stuff in general but I actually had some time for it on this album. Didn't stick around too long. I can hear what all the fuss was about  in terms of his incredible presence.
[11/22/24, 3:05:16 AM] Rory Edwards: Thought this was great. Emotional and impactful. On the verge of music is, much closer to poetry in places. His love and pride in his grandmother and determination to not repeat past mistakes quite touching, still, he came from a broken home...
[11/22/24, 3:09:46 AM] Neil Tilston: I think it's really cool. Interestingly Gil distanced himself from it a lot and said it was more a Richard Russell (producer and runner of XL label) album. Think Richard essentially interviewed Gil and got him to sing a couple of tracks then built the record around that. In a way it's more a portrait presented as an autobiography
[11/22/24, 3:10:46 AM] Neil Tilston: There's a couple of very cool reworkings of the album out there as well that I'd reccomend by Jamie XX and Maya mckraven
[11/22/24, 3:13:32 AM] Rory Edwards: I think this is a cool record,  A wistful, hopeful groove about the passing of time. In a week of very different records it maybe didn't grab my attention like some others on first listen but is probably the one I'll come back to most.
[11/22/24, 3:13:54 AM] Rory Edwards: Free choice bangers for those who haven't free chosen.
[11/22/24, 3:15:54 AM] Neil Tilston: I thought it was cool as well and will be revisiting also 👍🏻
[11/22/24, 5:20:04 AM] Fergus Neville: My over-ear headphones have also sadly broken after a good innings of 5 years. I have a bit of personal research money sloshing around and in a moment of Friday morning procrastination submitted a banter order to procurement for these, 100% expecting it to be bounced back with a reprimand.

[11/22/24, 6:22:53 AM] David Thomas: Brutal
[11/22/24, 6:27:53 AM] Fergus Neville: 🤣
[11/22/24, 6:28:59 AM] Fergus Neville: Tbf we won the pension battle after years of industrial action. Salaries are another question entirely which isn’t going to be improved anytime soon given lots of universities are on the edge of going bust.

[11/22/24, 8:40:50 AM] Fergus Neville: Last week, sorry!
[11/22/24, 8:41:01 AM] Neil Tilston: Oh right. What was that?
[11/22/24, 8:41:10 AM] Fergus Neville: I just pasted it!
[11/22/24, 8:42:08 AM] Fergus Neville: 👀

[11/22/24, 8:44:34 AM] Fergus Neville: Also you must have heard it last week unless you've been shirking listening duties 😛
[11/22/24, 8:44:56 AM] Neil Tilston: I definitely missed it. I usually listen and add to playlist together
[11/22/24, 8:45:19 AM] Fergus Neville: You gave the pick a thumbs-up at the time! Such a great track.
[11/22/24, 8:46:06 AM] Neil Tilston: I know the track like but was busy last weekend with rugby etc

[11/22/24, 8:46:41 AM] Fergus Neville: No problem! I just love the playlist (I put it on quite a lot) and noticed it wasn't on there when I went to listen to LL Cool J
[11/22/24, 8:50:50 AM] Neil Tilston: It's a cracking album as well
[11/22/24, 8:51:58 AM] Neil Tilston: Poly styrene was the real deal
[11/22/24, 8:52:44 AM] Neil Tilston: Lots of cool new releases today. Hoping I can shoehorn one into a new theme...
[11/22/24, 8:53:49 AM] David Thomas: Let’s make that difficult then
[11/22/24, 8:59:48 AM] David Thomas: I also do this, and love the singles playlist on shuffle for a bike ride or a run. I've noticed that the same tracks come up a lot, and fell down a rabbit hole last week looking at how spotify applies their 'shuffle' algorithm - lots of conspiracies that they weight the tracks based on the cheapest streaming rights to cost them less, which ends up with the same tracks coming up more often than not.
[11/22/24, 9:00:38 AM] Fergus Neville: Actually I pay a premium subscription to ensure that my picks get more plays on your bike rides
[11/22/24, 9:00:57 AM] David Thomas: anyway, made me think that we're all a product of the algorithm. this week's theme is 'beat the algorithm' - your pick has to be  based on something you see or hear out in the real world.
[11/22/24, 9:01:29 AM] David Thomas: hot chip every time
[11/22/24, 9:40:33 AM] Fergus Neville: Can the "real world" be non-algorithm online discovery e.g. if you follow a record label and they put out a new release which would never be recommended to you on Spotify?
[11/22/24, 9:40:48 AM] Fergus Neville: Or does it need to be physical discovery?
[11/22/24, 9:40:52 AM] David Thomas: Hmm
[11/22/24, 9:41:11 AM] David Thomas: Was going for physical discovery, but your always welcome to break the theme rules
[11/22/24, 9:41:36 AM] David Thomas: Did you discover the record label through your algorithm?
[11/22/24, 10:31:30 AM] Fergus Neville: No
[11/22/24, 10:43:12 AM] David Thomas: so at the risk of this sounding like it was a well thought out theme,  my pick ends up being a bit meta;

[11/22/24, 10:46:34 AM] David Thomas: took this photo this morning and was planning on picking one of the bands as my pick, but the first ones are all a bit 'local rock band'. went down this of upcoming shows on their website, and the first interesting sounding one is this guy;

[11/22/24, 10:50:54 AM] David Thomas: his biggest/viralist track is a "a guitar-centric rendition of Hudson Mohawke’s trap-EDM instrumental “Cbat,” which Cave has reharmonized, like a good jazz comp major, with a handful of slick extended chords. Viewers who spend too much time online will know “Cbat” for its role in a viral Reddit post about a hapless boyfriend’s poor choices in baby-making music."

[11/23/24, 5:11:33 AM] Rory Edwards: Canning all that because I've had them twice for better records. But a band I haven't picked twice that was a physical discovery for me - along with probably my all time top festival show - was The Flaming Lips.
[11/23/24, 5:12:16 AM] Rory Edwards: Had never paid the slightest bit of attention before they replaced the White Stripes on the main stage at T after Jack broke his finger.

One of our guests brought the vinyl of this in last week
[11/25/24, 5:46:31 AM] Neil Tilston: This is pretty cool. Reminded me of friendly fires but a bit more lo fi because of the production
[11/25/24, 5:48:12 AM] Neil Tilston: This is a masterpiece 
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
10/10
100/100
1000/1000

One of the greatest albums ever made. Full of emotion, wonder, darkness, light. I've been listening to this for a quarter of a century now and it's lost none of it's impact for me.
[11/25/24, 5:48:34 AM] Neil Tilston: This is borderline unlistenable
[11/25/24, 7:03:13 AM] Fergus Neville: Sounds like The Fall if they were American!
[11/25/24, 7:06:10 AM] Neil Tilston: I thought the first track was a bit like early nick cave
[11/25/24, 7:07:33 AM] Neil Tilston: After that it seemed to descend pretty quickly into a cacophony of barely coherent homophobic trash
[11/25/24, 7:08:22 AM] Fergus Neville: Hmm really? I missed the homophobia. Maybe need to give it a closer listen.

[11/25/24, 7:09:36 AM] Neil Tilston: The name had always put me off as I was worried it might be a bit like that
[11/25/24, 7:10:16 AM] Neil Tilston: The lyrics in Perry are also particularly unpleasant
[11/25/24, 7:10:37 AM] Fergus Neville: Fair enough. Apologies
[11/25/24, 7:11:07 AM] Neil Tilston: No apology needed at all. I'm a big boy and art is allowed to upset me.
[11/25/24, 7:11:11 AM] Neil Tilston: I just don't like it
[11/25/24, 7:12:49 AM] Neil Tilston: I've put the first track on the playlist 😂
[11/25/24, 7:13:20 AM] Neil Tilston: Although I did that for the Flips as well so that would seem to mess your theory up a bit
[11/25/24, 7:23:42 AM] Fergus Neville: Just because you always pick the first track when you hate an album, doesn't mean that if you pick the first track that you hate the album...
[11/25/24, 7:23:48 AM] Fergus Neville: Correlation/causation innit
[11/25/24, 7:31:00 AM] David Thomas: I think it’s super cool. Didn’t think it was that lowfi ! No stand out tunes, just good solid pop music with some wierd fun riffs in there.

[11/25/24, 7:31:12 AM] David Thomas: This seems to be his whole thing
[11/25/24, 12:53:22 PM] Fergus Neville: On the Flaming Lips, I discovered the BHS this week because Wayne Coyne sung one of their songs in 2003. Given that WC seems to be about the most progressive dude going, maybe their music wasn’t all homophobic?

_clings to straws_

[11/25/24, 1:35:48 PM] David Thomas: I’m not sure about homophobic,  I think it’s just a nonsense song about gay sex. Agree with you about it being borderline unlistenable tho
[11/25/24, 1:44:12 PM] Rory Edwards: It's a classic. It's not necessarily a philosophy I 100% share but I love their big, positive view of the potential of humankind. Some soaring and some tender personal moments on this too. It's also so hard to make an album this experimental and listenable at the same time. A++

[11/27/24, 2:56:08 PM] Rory Edwards: Think the Queensferry crew are going to make a weekend on it and we'll have a spare room by then as well.
[11/27/24, 2:56:53 PM] Rory Edwards: Haven't worked out how the pre-sale works yet but let me know if you fancy jumping in for some or any.

[11/27/24, 3:04:22 PM] Rory Edwards: I think I'm keen too. Consensus was we've got nothing on in March. Or at least nothing we're aware of. There are probably five things.

Heard this jazz standard this week
[11/28/24, 2:55:19 AM] Neil Tilston: And it has been rolling around in my head ever since
[11/28/24, 2:55:30 AM] Neil Tilston: Couldn't figure out where I know the melody from
[11/28/24, 2:55:41 AM] Neil Tilston: I figured it out!
[11/28/24, 2:55:53 AM] Neil Tilston: 10 points to anyone who gets it without me telling you
[11/28/24, 3:18:43 AM] Rory Edwards: I do know it. Will get there I'm sure.
[11/28/24, 3:20:44 AM] Neil Tilston: It's been on album club
[11/28/24, 3:26:15 AM] Rory Edwards: But of a punt but is it Summertime?
[11/28/24, 3:27:02 AM] Neil Tilston: No man more recent
[11/28/24, 3:28:32 AM] Rory Edwards: Hmm still think I'll get there.
[11/28/24, 6:07:56 AM] Fergus Neville: Reminds me of the bridge in She Loves You by The Beatles?
[11/28/24, 6:54:14 AM] David Thomas: It’s spectacular. Why has no one picked this yet?
[11/28/24, 7:00:24 AM] Neil Tilston: Sadly the version I have isn't on Spotify
[11/28/24, 7:00:24 AM] Neil Tilston: Shall I tell you what I was hearing?
[11/28/24, 9:17:40 AM] Fergus Neville: While Neil continues to tease us, something weird is going on with the listening figures for the different versions of Race For the Prize. They are different lengths so are definitely different versions, but both have 27,617,821 listens...any of you maths boys care to tell us the probability of that?

I think Ezra pinched the melody for this
[11/28/24, 11:48:08 AM] David Thomas: That’s so ridiculously obscure. Love it
[11/28/24, 11:48:33 AM] Fergus Neville: Pretty sure I've picked that record on here!
[11/28/24, 11:48:38 AM] Fergus Neville: Great track and album
[11/28/24, 11:50:03 AM] Fergus Neville: Actually no, it seems I picked Day of the Dog. That's overdue a pick then!
[11/28/24, 11:50:37 AM] David Thomas: Yeah, I remember telling you you’d picked the wrong album at the time
[11/28/24, 11:51:14 AM] Fergus Neville: Sounds about right

[11/28/24, 4:45:43 PM] Rory Edwards: Spent my evening drinking too much beer and wine with Jen and Brian's our small Scottish town has a normal one for Christmas lights switch on but just popping in to say great catch.
[11/28/24, 4:46:33 PM] Rory Edwards: This really good.
[11/28/24, 4:47:26 PM] Rory Edwards: And I actually quite liked the Butthole Surfers tunes. All sludgy bass and drums. Reminded me of the Pixies.
[11/28/24, 4:47:59 PM] Rory Edwards: Can't endorse the lyrics obvs and looking then up they seem like they are mainly shock jockies so don't really get a pass but hey ho.

[12/2/24, 4:24:00 AM] Fergus Neville: Quite early for a full review, but so far they're great. I've never had noise-cancelling headphones before and they're amazing! I'm currently listening to Low on the train and I can actually hear the music which is a big difference from previous headphones where I'd only attempt to play loud bassy music in a situation with lots of background noise. I just took them off to have my ticket checked and was almost deafened by how loud the train and other passengers were!

There's a wee app to play around with the equaliser etc but I've not used that too much yet. Pretty comfy so far although I've not worn them for a long period of time. IT services have stuck a crappy wee St Andrews asset tag sticker on them which is a bit annoying, but a small price to pay for zero price headphones.

This is so perfectly formed ❤️
[12/2/24, 3:58:43 PM] Fergus Neville: Absolutely stunning. Led to a whole new genre of slowgaze.
[12/2/24, 4:03:17 PM] Neil Tilston: Low are a band I like more every time I hear them. And I liked them the first time. A catalogue that keeps giving.
[12/2/24, 4:07:50 PM] Neil Tilston: My only criticism of the album is the cover at the end. Feels like it would be a lovely way to end a live show but for me it feels out of place on the album. Barring that I have nothing but praise for the beauty and majesty of this record.
[12/2/24, 4:10:22 PM] Fergus Neville: Agree with this too - I like the cover, but it doesn’t quite work there.
[12/2/24, 4:10:51 PM] Fergus Neville: Third low album picked on here and all have received good reviews (so far). Lots more to choose from too.

[12/5/24, 3:53:47 PM] Rory Edwards: So after a year with a lot of short hooky pop songs in it I really, really appreciated the slow burn layers of this  Agree about the cover but what a record all told. I don't think anyone has done this better.
[12/5/24, 3:54:39 PM] Rory Edwards: This is The Streets for millennials who now never go outside to the Streets. It started filly a bit silly but grew on me, a bit like never going outside to the Streets.
[12/5/24, 3:56:30 PM] Rory Edwards: This is a record full of really amazing tunes, some borderline masterpieces, but I find the transitions a little jarring 8/10.
[12/5/24, 3:57:09 PM] Rory Edwards: This is similar but with more samples. It holds together better as a record for me 9/10.
[12/5/24, 3:57:39 PM] Rory Edwards: Both deep and emotional with a fantastic interpretation of rhythm a really not much to do with drums.

I'm a massive fan of everything KH does but for me this is still the pinnacle. It's an incredible meld of styles, hip hop beats, glitchy idm clicks and glitches, jazz samples ... Somehow though he puts all that together and creates something that sounds warm rather than clinical. I absolutely love it 10+/10
[12/6/24, 4:24:25 AM] Neil Tilston: I agree this has some similar ingredients but personally do not agree at all that it's better . I obviously haven't known it as long or listened as many times so perhaps unfair for me to compare them. But Rory did (and got it wrong 😜). So I thought I should!
[12/6/24, 4:25:06 AM] Rory Edwards: Lol that's me telt 🤣

[12/6/24, 4:26:04 AM] Neil Tilston: I agree strongly with this review though. At first I thought it was odd for the sake of it but as I listened I got the idea and found it a great record using a unique approach to talk about mental health 👍🏻👍🏻
[12/6/24, 4:45:12 AM] Neil Tilston: Also reminded me of Gorillaz in places
[12/6/24, 5:10:50 AM] Neil Tilston: Banger. You got them on the list for Sunday?
[12/6/24, 5:11:19 AM] Fergus Neville: I discovered them on the list! Someone else has suggested them, but I'm fully on board.
[12/6/24, 5:11:36 AM] Neil Tilston: Slaps! My money is on Euan

[12/6/24, 9:08:34 AM] David Thomas: I’ve listened to this before, but have really tried this week. Three listens so far, each after one of you sends a superlative review along the lines of “Stupendous, reinvented shoelace folk” - and each time I get distracted after 2mins and have no lasting memory of any songs. Going in for listen #4 now - headphones up to max on the train, surely this one  will make an impression
[12/6/24, 9:25:40 AM] David Thomas: I think I’ve got the wrong kind of headphones, 🎧 it sounds all slow and dirgy on mine

[12/6/24, 9:44:42 AM] Fergus Neville: What are we looking at here? Are you slagging the photo? If you're making fun of them (especially Mimi) please let us know as that will work out very well for a counter-panning and your subsequent cancellation.
[12/6/24, 9:45:07 AM] David Thomas: The just look a bit like 100gecs in that photo
[12/6/24, 9:45:57 AM] Fergus Neville: For background, they were a husband and wife band. All very sweet. Sadly Mimi died a couple of years back after an illness which was obviously pretty tragic for all involved.
[12/6/24, 9:47:53 AM] Fergus Neville: Did you like this better when I picked it years ago? They became much louder in the last couple of albums.

[12/6/24, 9:57:30 AM] Fergus Neville: Mystery solved as Andy clearly has better taste than you. That pick has been bothering me for years.

[12/9/24, 4:25:06 PM] Neil Tilston: Yeah I think it's pretty fab. Was advocating hard for her to be high on the list for Big Rock next year. Just need the big cheese to give it the sign off when he scouts her gig next week! 🤞🏻 ‎<This message was edited>

He’d need speakers too, would like to get something that will last a few years in terms of sound, but not too expensive in case it never gets used. Entry level record player recommendations I guess?
[12/12/24, 11:17:40 AM] Neil Tilston: Entry level id go cheap and if he's using it loads then upgrade in the future. Those all in one suitcase things are dirty cheap and absolutely fine if his room isn't massive and it's just for him playing for himself in his room.

[12/12/24, 11:23:37 AM] David Thomas: About to buy a big old house (emphasis on old), so there’s a chance this would go in a bigger basement ‘game’ room/ living room at some point, but all very speculative right now! Any tips from those of you that have had work done on a house would be greatly appreciated - we’ll likely have a month or two after we buy before we need to move in, so considering doing a rush job on some renovations as the house will be empty. But we’re not sure what we’ll want to do until we move in 🤷‍♀️
[12/12/24, 11:24:11 AM] David Thomas: Yeah, would take him into the city and let him choose a few

[12/12/24, 11:27:56 AM] Rory Edwards: More seriously though anything you need to do to stuff that is under or on the floor becomes exponentially more difficult once you're in. In particular get the plumbing and fuse box checked.
[12/12/24, 11:28:18 AM] David Thomas: Can you do a full write up of what’s happening here? And how you pay for it/budget for it/find a contractor. If you can just tell me how to do it all that would be great.
[12/12/24, 11:30:17 AM] David Thomas: Yeah, that would be the plan, given we have a couple months left on our current rental house. The basement is completely unfinished right now, so question is if we get someone in to turn it into a finished room/extra bedroom/bathroom etc, or if we wait until we figure out what we want (think we’re gonna wait). All dependent on them accepting our extremely low ball offer, so not likely

[12/12/24, 1:02:32 PM] David Thomas: Yeah that’s fair. This one’s relatively new at 1940, but lots we’ve looked at just say ‘1900’ - so the records only go back to that far. Our last house was est 2010 so this is a new world of drafty/mousy/leaky that we’re not sure weee prepared for that

[12/13/24, 2:56:12 AM] Neil Tilston: Found this a tough listen tbh. My favourite was when he did the track that was more sample based and felt like a wee throwback to what Kanye and Common were putting out of Chicago in the 00s . If you'd picked that as a single I'd have sung it's praises but really struggled to get on board for 1h+ album
[12/13/24, 2:57:23 AM] Neil Tilston: I'm afraid this didn't really grab me! I'd better listen again as I know others in Big Rock are advocating hard for us to put them on so I'll definitely try again! I like the nice gentle drums but it was a bit wallpaper music for me

There's good stuff there for sure but definitely a much lower proportion I enjoy than the 90s and 00s ‎<This message was edited>

[12/13/24, 3:31:54 AM] Rory Edwards: I actually really like this though. Like the relentlessness of the production and the balls out flow. I'm not sure it has got a message worth listening to particularly but it's a big two fingers up of an album which is to be commended imo.
[12/13/24, 3:32:34 AM] Rory Edwards: -1 point for mentioning Drake a lot but +2 for each of those mentions basically being 'Drake sucks, listen to me'
[12/13/24, 3:34:45 AM] Rory Edwards: I liked this too although it hasn't stuck with me. Atmospheric edge provided by the strings. Suspect a grower.
[12/13/24, 3:38:15 AM] Rory Edwards: This was very quirky and good. I am really enjoying albums that go big on the female gaze atm - see Taylor etc - and am delighted that we are now getting ones in the gaze of that strange girl from school.
[12/13/24, 3:45:21 AM] Neil Tilston: What do you mean by "female gaze"? I always heard the phrase "male gaze" as something a bit creepy/pervy

[12/13/24, 3:50:53 AM] Rory Edwards: Just songs written as a woman sees the world with the imperfect bits left in. I suppose to call it that is a little pretentious but I didn't do it to sound clever. I'm just pretentious naturally.
[12/13/24, 3:53:48 AM] Rory Edwards: She does objectify a bit during that album so female gaze probably makes sense here. She just objectifies different things to men 'Oh my God, that family is hot, they really seem to be living the dream'

[12/18/24, 2:57:46 PM] David Thomas: currently back in the uk, enjoying a flat weak pint of ale in the premier inn pub in St Helens. Last minute flight back to see my parents. My dad passed away on Monday night after about 6months illness/stay in a care home with Alzheimer's and COPD. I'm saving AC/DC as my treat for my flight home on Sunday.
[12/18/24, 3:14:45 PM] Neil Tilston: So sorry to hear that mate . Loads of love to you and all the family ❤️
[12/18/24, 3:16:21 PM] Fergus Neville: Really really sorry to hear that Dave, I didn't know that he was ill. I always liked your Dad. We used to chat when he travelled up to watch you in Melstadt games and I was warming the bench. Much love to you all and I hope that AC/DC does the trick.
[12/18/24, 3:24:24 PM] David Thomas: thanks guys, much appreciated.
[12/18/24, 3:54:31 PM] Rory Edwards: Mate I'm so sorry to hear. Love to you all.
[12/20/24, 4:54:30 AM] Fergus Neville: What's the story with bangers today @⁨Rory Edwards⁩?
[12/20/24, 4:56:17 AM] Fergus Neville: I've enjoyed all the minkiness this week. My favourite Swift album picked so far (more beats not quite as tediously literal lyrics), and certainly better than the other one Rory keeps picking. It might help that I recognise most of the songs by this point given Aoife and Dee's influence.
[12/20/24, 5:23:20 AM] Rory Edwards: I am up for some filthy bangers provided @⁨David Thomas⁩ doesn't mind us continuing to witter about albums and pick terrible music in here. Whatever you're feeling mate I consider this a safe space to be or not to be.
[12/20/24, 5:29:19 AM] David Thomas: Filthy bangers please

[12/20/24, 3:08:56 PM] Rory Edwards: Apparently since it has made some list of top tunes I have to share it like this.
[12/20/24, 3:09:11 PM] Rory Edwards: Filthy though.
[12/20/24, 3:11:17 PM] Rory Edwards: I thought this was really strong musically with a wide range of cool influences coming through. Could hear Elvis and Bowie as well as the ones Neil mentioned. Great fun.
[12/20/24, 3:13:32 PM] Rory Edwards: Ridiculous name, throbbing chords, ferocious delivery, clears off before it does your head in, what's not to like?
[12/20/24, 3:14:56 PM] Rory Edwards: This sounds formulaic in places but groundbreaking in others and the whole thing is delivered with such a massive cheeky grin on its face you can't help but love it. Big Balls a tune for the ages imo.
[12/20/24, 3:17:44 PM] Rory Edwards: Done defending this woman, the music speaks for itself. This album isn't loved by critics and rarely a fans favourite either because there isn't as much story driven stuff you can play internet detective with.
[12/20/24, 3:21:45 PM] Rory Edwards: Starts at 100 miles per hour and keeps dropping beat driven bangers throughout. Some almost R&B stuff as variation which I normally wouldn't go for but the earworm production keeps me ticking over. Gorgeous would be a big low point if not so catchy.
[12/20/24, 3:21:46 PM] Rory Edwards: Tails off a bit as a few of Taylor's albums do.
[12/20/24, 3:22:58 PM] Rory Edwards: Ready for It one of my favourites of hers and Getaway Car a classic earworm cheesy pop tune that Marie can't stop singing.
[12/20/24, 3:22:59 PM] Rory Edwards: Fin
[12/21/24, 12:26:03 AM] Neil Tilston: Glad you liked it. I wouldn't say it's essential but the name popped in my head when you made the theme. A cool character in the CBGB scene who wore his oil influences very much on his sleeve
[12/21/24, 12:26:42 AM] Neil Tilston: Love Amyl some belting tracks in this album for sure but can't help find it a bit disappointing after comfort which was just awesome all the way through
[12/21/24, 12:27:07 AM] Neil Tilston: Great fun. Absolute nonsense. Make Spinal Tap look like Keane
[12/21/24, 12:28:49 AM] Neil Tilston: Like Fergus I enjoyed this more than previous Taylor entries. A quality and accomplished pop album. Thriller it ain't but still very good. I still don't quite get the reason for her massive status but then I'm not the target audience. No hate intended though. 7/10
[12/21/24, 12:31:33 AM] Neil Tilston: New theme ?
[12/21/24, 2:45:26 AM] Fergus Neville: Free choice this week I think.
[12/21/24, 4:14:55 AM] Rory Edwards: People are probably writing their PhDs about why she's so huge which I'm sure @⁨Fergus Neville⁩ is looking forward to reading and drawing little pans with tiny fried eggs in all over.

Not a Xmas album but I always think this one sounds great at this time of year.
[12/22/24, 2:13:26 PM] Fergus Neville: Love this record. And the theme was intentionally not-Christmas themed as I think we’ve already had most of the good ones (and some of the not so good ones!).

"Fergus, can we not ask Mermaid Chunky to play Big Rock?" 🙏🏻
[12/23/24, 8:38:48 AM] Fergus Neville: Nonsense. I discovered it from Pictish Trail’s list of favourite albums from 2024. Here’s his review:
‎[12/23/24, 8:38:57 AM] Fergus Neville: ‎image omitted
[12/23/24, 8:39:17 AM] Fergus Neville: It’s properly weird and I love it. Intentionally not a Christmas album!
[12/23/24, 8:39:50 AM] Neil Tilston: I agree that it's properly weird and not a Christmas album. Two out of three ain't bad 😂
[12/23/24, 8:41:17 AM] Neil Tilston: I'm a bit under the weather and listening from my Christmas sick bed so might not have the levels of patience required for it. The Mavericks are proving a more suitable tonic
[12/23/24, 8:43:15 AM] Fergus Neville: Rubbish, sorry to hear that. Hope you feel better soon 👍
[12/23/24, 8:46:10 AM] David Thomas: also absolutely choked with the cold after a week of airports and hospitals - Neil i'm glad we didn't meet up, I would have felt guilty for getting you sick!  Back home in Philly now, sorry i didn't get a chance to meet up with anyone - likely a few more trips home on the horizon dealing with my mum and my dad's funeral etc, so really hoping i get to spend a night in the pub up with you's at some point!
[12/23/24, 8:51:06 AM] Neil Tilston: Glad you're home safe with the family but. Hope you're able to get some rest and comfort at home for a few days. Keep us posted about your plans to be back over. Would be great to see you.
[12/24/24, 7:05:35 AM] Fergus Neville: First track pick says it all 😔
[12/24/24, 8:23:39 AM] Rory Edwards: Not sure wtf Neil has got against pansexual, disco, chamber musicians but I thought this was great.
[12/24/24, 8:23:39 AM] Rory Edwards: Also deeply weird but why not?
[12/24/24, 8:49:03 AM] Fergus Neville: Yaaas Rory! Christmas is saved!
[12/24/24, 8:50:20 AM] Fergus Neville: My sister Lucy just gave me the newest Soccer Mommy LP for my birthday. Dave’s picked them before but not this album. My brother-in-law’s album of the year apparently.
[12/24/24, 8:54:40 AM] Neil Tilston: I've nothing against any of those things if it doesn't sound awful
‎[12/24/24, 9:29:07 AM] Neil Tilston: ‎image omitted
[12/24/24, 9:37:07 AM] Fergus Neville: You should probably buy something for Aine too
[12/24/24, 10:49:02 AM] Neil Tilston: She has Kylie tix
[12/24/24, 10:50:49 AM] Fergus Neville: Nice one!
[12/24/24, 12:21:50 PM] Rory Edwards: In fairness I may have to concede this is a better album than Ferg's pick.
[12/24/24, 12:22:21 PM] Rory Edwards: I am always interested in the narrative in this record, is there one? If so how many different characters are there?
[12/24/24, 12:22:49 PM] Rory Edwards: There are probably a bunch of different ways to read it which is fun.
[12/24/24, 12:23:05 PM] Rory Edwards: I'm sure there are essays. Anyway the tunes are all amazing
[12/24/24, 12:50:11 PM] Neil Tilston: Apparently the title "Time out of mind" is a reference to what Dylan saw as a group of songs that had been rattling around his head for years but he'd never managed to flesh out. By not thinking about them for a while (hence the title) he was able to return to them and make them work. ‎<This message was edited>
[12/24/24, 12:51:11 PM] Neil Tilston: I love how bluesy the record is. Lanois gives the production just the right amount of polish. It's a gem of a record ‎<This message was edited>
[12/24/24, 12:58:12 PM] Fergus Neville: I have it on now. Definitely one of my favourite Dylan records, not least because it’s the only one I’ve seen him tour.

[12/24/24, 1:00:51 PM] Fergus Neville: Hang on, he doesn’t seem to have played any tracks on the album! Is that right @⁨Neil Tilston⁩?! Aberdeen, Sept 2000.
[12/24/24, 1:01:42 PM] Fergus Neville: Actually there were 2 tracks. I guess that’s about as much as you get given his back catalogue.
[12/24/24, 1:02:09 PM] Fergus Neville: I remember he played the Hendrixish version of All Along The Watchtower which was very cool.
[12/24/24, 1:14:09 PM] Neil Tilston: That is when we saw him and not dark yet is both on the album and that setlist
[12/24/24, 1:14:31 PM] Neil Tilston: Also cold irons bound
[12/24/24, 1:14:54 PM] Neil Tilston: Things have changed was a single around that time as well but not on the album
[12/24/24, 1:15:18 PM] Fergus Neville: 👍

[12/27/24, 12:08:09 PM] Fergus Neville: Would love to but have had a pint now so can’t drive him. May weave over on the bike later, but it would be late as have promised Finlay a lads’ night as Aoife’s at a sleepover. We have the Empire Strikes Back all set up which he’s never seen.

[12/28/24, 10:37:44 AM] Neil Tilston: I guess it's got to be your favourite of the year. Or if that's already been on the club then something you've seen on an end of year list but haven't listened to yet .
[12/28/24, 10:40:13 AM] Neil Tilston: Give this album a listen: Littoral Zone

[12/29/24, 9:44:34 AM] David Thomas: Not necessarily best album of the year. But lovely little 2000s sounding indie/preppy/surf punk-y album I’m enjoying right now
[12/29/24, 9:44:42 AM] David Thomas: 10/10 band name
[12/29/24, 9:58:40 AM] Neil Tilston: Goes well with brocccoli
[12/30/24, 7:09:43 AM] Neil Tilston: This is ace I really like it. I remember in the 90s/00s lots of acts like the chemical brothers, uncle, death in Vegas etc were trying to incorporate Britpop into dance music but none of them did it with jungle. They should have. This is wicked.
[12/30/24, 7:11:24 AM] Neil Tilston: It's not what I was expecting at all. But I realise that's because I had her confused with another ace artist with a similar name

[12/30/24, 11:23:51 AM] Fergus Neville: We have some friends over tonight and will have a listening party. They have some 2024 recommendations I haven’t heard of 👍
[12/30/24, 11:44:39 AM] Fergus Neville: In the pub now and our friends are falling out about which album I should pick. Some _strong_ opinions 😆
[12/30/24, 11:48:13 AM] Neil Tilston: In my head they're all saying Taylor swift and you're the one with the _strongest_ opinion
[12/30/24, 11:48:50 AM] Fergus Neville: Everyone has their phones out now looking at their Wrapped
[12/30/24, 11:49:02 AM] Fergus Neville: No-one except Aoife is saying Swift
[12/30/24, 11:49:42 AM] Neil Tilston: If Aoife is there then I can accept that you might only have the second strongest opinion
[12/30/24, 11:49:47 AM] Fergus Neville: Katie is our friend who used to be in Bright Eyes and now rejects all male navel-gazing nonsense. She’s mostly into drill and hardcore now.
[12/30/24, 6:51:04 PM] Fergus Neville: Katie was pitching hard for The Cure, but after an evening of listening and drinking, I’m going to go for this

[1/3/25, 8:45:49 AM] Rory Edwards: I enjoyed my listening this week, we've been moving house about once every three days so apols for not much chat. A bit stressed out out our box tbh.
[1/3/25, 8:46:32 AM] Neil Tilston: Sorry to hear that man. Saw Bethany on Hogmanay and she updated me on it all. Sounds like a mare
[1/3/25, 8:47:19 AM] Rory Edwards: I thought this had ace melodies but found it a bit sickly sweet after a while. Lyrics also a mixed bag for me, occasionally naive sounding then occasionally very profound, almost Dylanesque when they landed.
[1/3/25, 8:47:32 AM] Rory Edwards: Thought he was ace live.
[1/3/25, 8:47:35 AM] David Thomas: Rory, could you share a quick house update for those of us who might want to avoid all that?

[1/3/25, 2:38:25 PM] David Thomas: I missed that Neil had picked this one - listened today, and loved it. The naive/profound lyrics work perfectly with his childlike delivery imho, I love it. One of the great album club finds for me, sad I couldn’t see him live.
[1/3/25, 2:39:09 PM] David Thomas: Feel like he’s aiming for Hamish hawk style song structure a bit in this album, can’t decide if I prefer the first album sound or not ‎<This message was edited>
[1/3/25, 2:39:53 PM] David Thomas: AC alum Andrew Wasylyk produced this one!!
[1/3/25, 2:42:00 PM] David Thomas: I had a missed call from you Rory - were you just going to replicate this gif over the phone?
[1/3/25, 8:10:32 PM] David Thomas: Was absolutely seething for none of my picks even making the extended list here, but just noticed Kneecap and The Paranoid Style. Will take it, something to build on next season ‎<This message was edited>
[1/4/25, 6:09:31 AM] Neil Tilston: Glad this has gone down generally well. Interesting to hear Rory's thoughts on the songwriting. I'm vary fond of Adam's songwriting and I can hear what you mean about him sounding naive but I've always found it quite charming. I love his turns of phrase. Good spot from Dave that Andrew Wasylyk produced it. I love all the jazzy flourishes in the music and have found it really rewards repeat listens .
[1/4/25, 6:11:26 AM] Neil Tilston: I did quite enjoy beeef . Perhaps a little forgettable but an enjoyable listen all the same 👍🏻
[1/4/25, 6:12:33 AM] Neil Tilston: Was unconvinced about this to begin with but it definitely won me over. Quite a charming and refreshing album. Like Wilco fronted by Neil Young for Gen Z
[1/5/25, 2:21:52 AM] Rory Edwards: To be clear I don't think he's bad. I actually think he's very good and could grow to be absolutely great as he keeps making music. Just the odd line falls flat and he goes to humour a bit too much for me.
[1/5/25, 2:21:59 AM] Rory Edwards: Free choice this week.
[1/5/25, 6:49:41 AM] Neil Tilston: Give this album a listen: Acts of Faith

[1/7/25, 3:21:23 AM] Rory Edwards: Sorry hadn't realised I haven't posted..Been minorly obsessed with this spiralling spacey, post hardcore piece I think made by a single individual in their room. Give this album a listen: Monarch of Monsters

[1/7/25, 3:56:46 PM] Rory Edwards: This is class. Like peak Radiohead in places. Like the tightest gospel band in the history of the Baptist movement in others. All the stars.
[1/7/25, 4:40:57 PM] Neil Tilston: Glad you like it man. I honestly think SAULT have been the best band on the planet for the last decade. This feels like a follow up to the last Untitled album they did (they've made 11 albums and an ep and they only started in 2019). I'd recommend that as well if you like it.
[1/7/25, 4:45:00 PM] Neil Tilston: Give this album a listen: Untitled (God)
https://open.spotify.com/album/106QT3POAohZwyjbesTK5L?si=mo6OhcZwTEGX8J9CUkY6qg
[1/8/25, 4:08:10 AM] Rory Edwards: This is very good too. On the country side of folk. Vocal and and melodies both incredibly strong. I think Bored is a huge tune in particularly but the quality is mad high throughout.
[1/8/25, 9:40:29 AM] Fergus Neville: This isn't normally my sort of thing, but I've enjoyed it more than expected while working on a grant app. Bonus points for some amusing track names 👍
[1/8/25, 9:56:50 AM] Rory Edwards: This is better feedback than I expected. Was never going to be for everyone but personally I find it really stirring. Soaring synth pop and hardcore, tracks often building to spectacular cacophonous crescendos while at the same time being a deeply personal record. Think the closest thing I can compare it to musically is The Mars Volta.
[1/8/25, 9:58:12 AM] Rory Edwards: I do think some tunes could develop a bit quicker. PLAY DEAD! PLAY DEAD! a great example of when the album is at its best for that reason.
[1/8/25, 9:58:24 AM] Rory Edwards: Regardless is is some achievement for one person in their room.
[1/8/25, 11:35:19 AM] Fergus Neville: Newport community Facebook group is wild btw…
[1/8/25, 11:35:25 AM] Fergus Neville: FYI to the 2 guys in Balaclavas at 1:30am -2am this morning trying car doors on our estate (the new builds)…..if/when I catch you trying that again, it will be the last time you do it.  
You may think you can get away with it as there’s no police station nearby….but this works both ways and we’re sick of your type of scum around here.  
Police may not be interested, but we are….so unless you like a swim in the Tay at that time of the morning, I suggest you stay well away
Next time I’ll be bypassing the call to the police (since they still haven’t turned up) and I’ll be dealing with you myself.  
It’s difficult to identify a body floating down the Tay if it’s got a balaclava on aswell……
[1/8/25, 11:46:44 AM] Neil Tilston: You should have at least sent Richard Grieve a text before you went on Facebook bud! 😜
[1/8/25, 1:58:44 PM] Rory Edwards: The only way is the Ferry Facebook group loves a bit of this.
[1/8/25, 2:00:31 PM] Rory Edwards: Forgot to mention this album includes a 22 minute track. An album club record? Probably Skinny Fists has longer ones. Anyway @⁨David Thomas⁩ can just listen to that if he wants the EP version.
[1/8/25, 5:08:06 PM] David Thomas: Also think this is great, if a little ‘smoothed over’ - this might hit be only because you told us it  was made by one person in their bedroom, but it feels a bit paint by numbers, play dead especially a bit too smooth for something that ferocious - lacking the depth of a real drummer maybe?
[1/8/25, 5:08:57 PM] David Thomas: The synthy stuff work better - numetal at it’s finest
[1/8/25, 5:14:03 PM] David Thomas: Can’t let three reviews come in without mentioning the absolute state of the album art. Had to google it to even know what to describe - have you read the accompanying furry porn novela @⁨Rory Edwards⁩ ??
[1/8/25, 5:45:34 PM] Rory Edwards: Don't kink shame. Show me the man hasn't got off to someone dressed as a fluffy purple unicorn wearing a Macdonald's uniform. I was in politics and everything
[1/9/25, 2:34:52 AM] Neil Tilston: Rory coming out as a bromy wasn't on my list of things I thought would happen this week.
[1/9/25, 4:56:05 AM] Rory Edwards: In more serious news, lab has found no asbestos so builders are back 🎉
[1/9/25, 4:56:34 AM] Fergus Neville: 👍👍
[1/9/25, 8:42:30 AM] David Thomas: This sounds like a cross between ‘Fucked Up’ and Chubby and the gang - which makes sense cos it’s produced by the guy from Fucked Up, and Chubby is the guitarist. I think it’s good, maybe not great, but good fun.
[1/9/25, 11:31:07 AM] Rory Edwards: I enjoyed being yelled at for half an hour by this lot. Only felt guilty once - I haven't said anything in a while. Proper punk album. I think if it had dropped in punks heyday it might have been a classic.
[1/10/25, 8:23:58 AM] Rory Edwards: Bangers are free choice too obvs. Have very much enjoyed our eclectic week.

[1/10/25, 8:35:29 AM] Neil Tilston: This was certainly a bit different and interesting. It certainly has things to admire and I think you explained well why you like it. I'm undecided whether I actually like it or not. Suspect it's just not my cup of tea. I find the combination of hyper pop and hardcore emo a bit jarring tbh. I might be converted yet though
[1/10/25, 8:35:46 AM] Neil Tilston: Surprisingly it reminded me of a Scottish band I saw a couple of years ag

[1/11/25, 4:50:52 PM] Fergus Neville: I stand by it as an interesting pick given the options available
[1/11/25, 4:51:14 PM] Neil Tilston: Absolutely it's probably one of the greatest albums of the yray
[1/11/25, 4:51:19 PM] Fergus Neville: Franz Ferdinand still available. It’s meant to be quite good actually.
[1/11/25, 4:51:34 PM] Neil Tilston: BECAUSE WEVE ONLY HAD FIELVE MINUTES OF THE YEAR SO FAR
[1/11/25, 4:52:18 PM] David Thomas: Gonna make my album of the year list tomorrow and it’s just gonna be three albums at this rate Neil
[1/11/25, 4:52:19 PM] Neil Tilston: I mean get be drunk on a train

[1/11/25, 4:53:30 PM] Fergus Neville: Neil drinking by himself on a train and trolling a boy in Philly is great entertainment

[1/12/25, 9:17:41 AM] David Thomas: “Its your god given duty to appreciate my booty” is a strong contender for lyric of the year here
[1/12/25, 9:18:28 AM] Fergus Neville: Don’t see Ringo beating that
[1/12/25, 10:36:20 AM] Neil Tilston: I'm disappointed it wasn't his lyric
[1/13/25, 9:04:16 AM] Fergus Neville: "Michael, I don't want to suck you off on my lunch break" is a close second
[1/13/25, 10:17:59 AM] Fergus Neville: A lovely 37 minutes of gentle americana, bluegrass and blues! It's not the greatest piece of musicianship you've ever heard, but it leaves you smiling. Much like good ol' Ringo himself.
[1/13/25, 10:30:42 AM] David Thomas: Always fun to get a album club message pop up on my laptop when I’m presenting
[1/13/25, 10:31:14 AM] Fergus Neville: Your pick, your fault
[1/13/25, 10:38:55 AM] David Thomas: This was definitely your pick??
[1/13/25, 10:39:14 AM] Fergus Neville: The offending lyric was from the Labrini Girls
[1/13/25, 10:39:23 AM] David Thomas: Oh! Yeah
[1/13/25, 10:39:27 AM] Fergus Neville: So suck on that during your lunchbreak
[1/13/25, 11:56:02 AM] Rory Edwards: After brief research this is my 2025 pick. Tom Waits meets Bon Iver I think it's a genuinely great addition to the rambling baritone genre but let's see what the resident Waitsonians think. https://open.spotify.com/track/3zaztO9QEefcS7MBZNs9vP?si=_QuOmRlVS0Chj0h52ZyG8A
[1/13/25, 11:56:41 AM] David Thomas: Excellent work Rory

[1/13/25, 1:28:37 PM] Fergus Neville: I believe Ringo did some good work in the 1960s. Just how flexible are these rules?
[1/13/25, 1:30:02 PM] David Thomas: Was honestly expecting a bunch of picks of artists who had upcoming releases, but then Neil went off on one and made it a much better theme

Here's my friday banger in advance!
[1/14/25, 11:23:24 AM] David Thomas: This is good, if a little understated for my tastes. I picked his main band Geese a while back, and am enjoying a relisten
[1/14/25, 11:23:50 AM] David Thomas: 👀
[1/17/25, 1:54:46 AM] Neil Tilston: I do have a banger ready from 2025 if it's the same theme for singles @⁨David Thomas⁩ ?
[1/17/25, 5:41:53 AM] Neil Tilston: Sounds interesting:

[1/17/25, 6:23:22 AM] Rory Edwards: Yeah it really does.
[1/17/25, 6:28:42 AM] David Thomas: Did they just re-invent ‘the radio’?
[1/17/25, 6:30:21 AM] Rory Edwards: I think you'll find the term is "disrupted the musical discovery market'
[1/17/25, 6:31:53 AM] Rory Edwards: I think what makes it different is that actual alive people at Discogs are saying that this is this genre or that.
[1/17/25, 6:36:47 AM] David Thomas: Like, a radio presenter?

2025 banger
[1/17/25, 8:58:33 AM] Neil Tilston: I've definitely pushed Cymande before here. VERY excited for imminent new album. If you get a chance to see the doc that came out last year please do. They're story is fascinating and the music of the highest quality.

[1/17/25, 12:06:18 PM] Rory Edwards: Total tune this. Worth every second.
[1/17/25, 12:07:14 PM] Neil Tilston: They're an incredible band  Insane it's their first new music in 50 years!
[1/17/25, 12:07:52 PM] Rory Edwards: This was certainly a thing. Thought it was completely obnoxious and then it kinda of grew on me. Think there are a few tunes that will be sampled like mad but as an album, catchy in places but meh.
[1/17/25, 12:08:35 PM] Rory Edwards: This reminded me of early Beatles lyrically and had some ok Americana behind it. I don't really like early Beatles.
[1/17/25, 12:09:44 PM] Rory Edwards: I think the tunes and lyrics are good here. Lots of very up to date lefty and feminist themes. I don't like the vocal much which put me off a bit. Personal taste though, I think it will be good to most people. ‎<This message was edited>
[1/17/25, 12:10:53 PM] Rory Edwards: This might depend if you like rambling baritone but I think the tunes underneath are lush as well. Lots of sleighbell.
[1/17/25, 12:11:02 PM] Rory Edwards: That's how they roll.
[1/17/25, 12:14:55 PM] Neil Tilston: This had some cool moments reminded me of early stuff from the likes of the national and clap your hands say yeah etc. production was very sparse to the point where things almost sounded like demos
[1/17/25, 12:15:06 PM] Neil Tilston: The Ringo album was rotten
[1/17/25, 12:15:20 PM] Neil Tilston: Best of the week by far but strims did rig the theme
[1/17/25, 12:20:28 PM] Fergus Neville: Got his comeuppance when I quoted the lyrics during his presentation though #karma
[1/18/25, 5:09:44 AM] Fergus Neville: This week’s theme is records released this morning
[1/18/25, 5:10:09 AM] Neil Tilston: Between 9.30 and 9.40 only right?
[1/18/25, 5:18:21 AM] Fergus Neville: I like to round inwards, so 9.31 to 9.39
[1/18/25, 5:19:04 AM] Rory Edwards: What if you're having a nice sit down and miss the window?
[1/18/25, 5:19:04 AM] Fergus Neville: If that’s too niche for you fusspots, then the alternative theme is fashion

[1/18/25, 6:29:33 AM] Rory Edwards: Yeah I heard some ambient stuff by them which I like but they seem to be upping the tempo a little.
[1/18/25, 9:12:38 AM] David Thomas: Great theme - what was the inspiration here?
[1/18/25, 9:13:30 AM] Fergus Neville: It was inspired by White Denim having a new album out with good reviews 😆

This sounds like Stevie Wonder ♥️
[1/19/25, 12:58:28 PM] Neil Tilston: Why did you choose this particular album? Raising Hell is my goto Run DMC album and contains "my Adidas" which would justify it fitting the theme better.  I'm aware this sounds like a classics album club "picked the wrong album" reply but I'm genuinely interested what your reasons are - if you have them.
[1/19/25, 1:41:18 PM] Neil Tilston: It's a great album anyway and I enjoyed listening to an album of theirs that I don't know as well. It's cool how some of the tracks are almost covers.
[1/19/25, 2:00:26 PM] Rory Edwards: To be honest mate it was just the first one I listened to of theirs in my recent hip hop discovery sessions and you know how you get stuck on the first listen.
[1/19/25, 2:00:44 PM] Rory Edwards: Think it's great and will post some words about it when I've listened again this week.
[1/20/25, 5:57:25 AM] Fergus Neville: Yeah, they're a lot more soulful than their garage rock roots (which I also loved).

[1/21/25, 11:35:27 AM] Fergus Neville: This is a Best Of, right? Surely this is a Best Of?!
[1/21/25, 11:38:34 AM] David Thomas: one of the greatest double albums ever?
[1/21/25, 11:38:49 AM] Fergus Neville: Sensational
[1/21/25, 11:39:05 AM] Fergus Neville: Great pick, can't believe we've not had any Elton
[1/21/25, 11:39:20 AM] David Thomas: go to be honest, had a quick panic then that it was a best of
[1/21/25, 11:40:08 AM] David Thomas: my next theme after all the moaning on my last one was going to be 'open ended date, but it had better be the best fucking album we haven't had yet
[1/21/25, 11:40:16 AM] David Thomas: this one would have made the cut for sure
[1/21/25, 12:26:18 PM] Neil Tilston: Yeah it's his magnum opus. He has many great songs but this is almost certainly his greatest album ♥️
[1/23/25, 8:28:48 PM] David Thomas: right chat, i buttered you up with elton's magnum opus, and now have a favor to ask - Old Donny Trump is up to his old tricks again, and we thought that our kids were briefly made non-citizens at one point this week. long story short - we're applying for british passports for them toot suite - will one of you's upstanding professionals verify their identify for us?

[1/24/25, 8:25:40 AM] David Thomas: Really into tracks by obscure pop bands collaborating with 90s indie stars
[1/24/25, 8:49:37 AM] Rory Edwards: Time for some one (maybe two) sentence reviews.
[1/24/25, 8:50:41 AM] Rory Edwards: This is a classy record musically. I sometimes think his vocal isn't quite the same quality and sometimes think that's the charm.
[1/24/25, 8:52:49 AM] Rory Edwards: Thought this was ace. Huge mix of influences, lyrically strong, just the right amount of whimsy A++
[1/24/25, 8:54:38 AM] Rory Edwards: Very magnum opussy . I don't think Elton gets the credit he deserves among some serious music fans probably partly because he was so big and partly because of associations. At his bombastic best here with some good wistful stuff as well.
[1/24/25, 8:56:06 AM] Fergus Neville: This storm is getting on my tits now. Greenhouse is being rattled to pieces with bits of broken glass all over the garden, and fearful to take the dog for a walk expecting a wheeliebin in the chops.
[1/24/25, 8:57:40 AM] Rory Edwards: Believe this was one of the records that paved the way for the golden age and you can say why. Slick to even better than slick production that gets a tonne out of a drum loop, great rhymes and engaging flow with the different voices used to switch things up.
[1/24/25, 8:58:01 AM] Neil Tilston: I like it. Obviously the distance is a total standout. At it's best it's like listening to eels jam with a mariachi band. Some of the later stuff is a bit silly and reminds me of barenaked ladies but if I'm in the right frame of mind it's mostly fun.
[1/24/25, 8:58:39 AM] Neil Tilston: Except "Italian leather sofa" that track is whack
[1/24/25, 8:59:29 AM] Neil Tilston: At first I found it a bit generic but I think it's the whimsyness of it that won me over. A very charming record.
[1/24/25, 8:59:31 AM] Rory Edwards: I know hip hop talks about black and black music identity a lot but I feel this is a statement record for that. It's like they are putting in their claim for top billing, with the almost covers essentially saying 'we own this tune/genre now'. Awesome record.
[1/24/25, 8:59:46 AM] Neil Tilston: Aye it's fabulous ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
[1/24/25, 9:00:31 AM] Rory Edwards: I don't get on with 'Race Car Ya Yas'. Find it a bit sneery.
[1/24/25, 9:00:36 AM] Neil Tilston: I enjoyed it loads. Still think Raising Hell is better though 😜
[1/24/25, 9:02:28 AM] Rory Edwards: Lame. We just had to chase recycling everywhere and I got lidded.
[1/24/25, 9:03:11 AM] Rory Edwards: Today's banger. https://open.spotify.com/track/6ie2Bw3xLj2JcGowOlcMhb?si=GJdBPAEUR72tTC4AsfvuIQ
[1/24/25, 9:04:58 AM] Rory Edwards: Wind just managed to move the skip in our garden despite it being half full.
[1/24/25, 9:09:34 AM] David Thomas: huge cake fan - i bought the cd single of the distance when it came out - the b side was a jolene cover. but even i agree that cake are better in small doses, and i’m usually done with their nonsense after a full album.
[1/24/25, 9:10:40 AM] David Thomas: loads of great track here - stick shifts, its coming down, i will survive is great, italian leather sofa, really great album

[1/25/25, 6:48:50 AM] Neil Tilston: Fergus will be delighted that as it's burns night the theme is Scottish artists. Albums new and old welcome

Huey Morgan is saying king of rock is the best run DMC album so apparently we're both wrong @⁨Rory Edwards⁩ !
[1/25/25, 7:50:26 AM] Neil Tilston: Block party this week is a tribute to the album as it's 40 years old
[1/25/25, 7:51:23 AM] David Thomas: is this our theme?
[1/25/25, 7:51:37 AM] Neil Tilston: This is theme

I was very excited when I first heard the pre album singles from this. Then when I heard it I was a little underwhelmed. One of our regulars on Tuesday insists it's their best since Screamadelica and I need to give it another go. I'm amazed that Fergus hasn't picked it yet!
[1/27/25, 5:25:32 PM] Fergus Neville: I’ve not really got into it myself yet. This is good motivation to make another effort 👍
[1/27/25, 5:26:55 PM] Fergus Neville: Bobby G’s Dad on the cover btw! 😎
[1/29/25, 7:29:58 AM] David Thomas: Sorry all - late to the theme this week. My dad’s funeral on Monday, so we all flew home for   a rapid trip, back in Philly today completely exhausted with thankfully a day off work to recover. Funeral went well, was nice to see all my uncles and aunties from my dad’s side.
[1/29/25, 7:30:52 AM] David Thomas: Given that it’s Wednesday- here’s an ep
[1/29/25, 7:31:06 AM] David Thomas: https://open.spotify.com/album/7IBKsN43AlunQwU7scSCuA?si=rTSSOoiyQzGcyJ_wtJhNUw
[1/29/25, 7:36:29 AM] Fergus Neville: I'm glad it went well. Great effort bringing over the whole family.
[1/29/25, 7:36:35 AM] Fergus Neville: I've missed your EPs x
[1/29/25, 8:38:06 AM] Neil Tilston: Lots of love to you mate I'm sure that's been a very all consuming week. Hope you manage to get some rest today.
[1/29/25, 8:50:35 AM] David Thomas: Watched the Kneecap movie on the plane back - really good, definitely worth a watch.
[1/29/25, 8:50:39 AM] David Thomas: https://www.netflix.com/us/title/81956594?s=i&trkid=0&vlang=en
[1/29/25, 9:52:11 AM] Rory Edwards: So pleased to hear it went well mate. Much love to you and all.
[1/30/25, 4:14:35 AM] Neil Tilston: I stand by my initial impression of the album. Some absolutely stunning gospel/disco influenced bangers amongst the singles. But as a whole it's not a great album. There's just too many sludgy dirges with Bobby wailing and muttering badly
[1/30/25, 4:25:48 AM] Rory Edwards: Yeah agree entirely. Melancholy Man was such a slog of a tune.
[1/30/25, 4:27:35 AM] Neil Tilston: The weird thing is I absolutely have found on my favourite Primal scream albums a more laid back and reflective tune to be a lovely island within the record.

The best examples being Damaged on Screamadelica and Keep Your Dreams on XTRMNTR. But here it's half the record and those tracks are pish.
[1/30/25, 4:28:36 AM] Neil Tilston: Agree entirely about Melancholy man but also found most of the second half similarly dull
[1/30/25, 4:29:06 AM] Rory Edwards: It was really good when it was good though.
[1/30/25, 4:31:05 AM] Rory Edwards: Reminded me of the best bits of Reflector with a Screamadilica gospel edge added.
[1/30/25, 4:31:33 AM] Rory Edwards: Afraid nostalgia couldn't save this for me. The first tune was good, the other versions of it got samey quite quickly and the lyrics are extremely trite and dull. It's like a parody. Maybe it was meant to be, haven't checked.
[1/30/25, 5:32:48 AM] Fergus Neville: I actually though the 9 min closer - Settlers Blues - performed this role pretty well!
[1/30/25, 5:33:12 AM] Fergus Neville: Agree with your overall assessment. Enjoyed some of the tracks a lot, the rest washed over me a bit
[1/30/25, 5:33:23 AM] Rory Edwards: Yeah I liked that one.
[1/30/25, 5:34:34 AM] Fergus Neville: I actually don't have nostaliga for this as it's a releatively new "find" for me. I just like the guitar sound really without listening too closely to the lyrics. I think it originally got a famously bad review in NME/Melody Maker or something, which people still look back and laugh it.
[1/30/25, 5:37:17 AM] Neil Tilston: Should have been an ep
[1/30/25, 5:40:51 AM] Rory Edwards: It sounds extremely of its time guitar wise. Like somebody has tried to make the most early 90s record ever.
[1/30/25, 5:43:42 AM] Fergus Neville: It was very influential - as I understand it it's less of a rip-off than a trendsetter which others then copied
[1/30/25, 6:27:07 AM] Neil Tilston: I quite liked it
[1/30/25, 7:35:15 AM] David Thomas: This is gorgeous. A perfect ‘Monday morning’ listen on my first day back at work with a stinking cold 🤧
[1/30/25, 2:56:56 PM] Neil Tilston: I loved the bus song from this when you picked it for singles club and I loved it again this week. My favourite of the week! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿

[1/31/25, 6:36:13 AM] Rory Edwards: I really love it. So unusual but an incredible fusion of styles. 'Composed' rather than written. It is meant to go with a theatre piece but I think works just as well on record.

[2/6/25, 9:18:28 AM] Rory Edwards: Kinda ignores the misery bit which most albums about drinking and history seems to go in for.
[2/6/25, 9:19:31 AM] Rory Edwards: This was more in that vein but sounded beautiful. My mum, dad and MiL all worked in the fish factories in Buckie and Aberdeen which was vaguely nostalgic.
[2/6/25, 11:01:40 AM] Rory Edwards: Hope folk enjoyed the turbocharged strings of this. Insane technical skill on show and creates a deep atmosphere for me. Apparently their live shoes add synth and beats to be almost night club like so I'm on the lookout.
[2/6/25, 11:05:37 AM] Rory Edwards: I also thought this was a really strong and varied offer from team MacCrimmon. Again deeply atmospheric, tunes and record built beautifully. Great technical stuff on show without going over the top. Caught the joy and the sadness of the story. Great album.
[2/6/25, 11:06:14 AM] Rory Edwards: Not sure who won my week but for the sake of sledging @⁨Fergus Neville⁩ loses for picking a compilation.

He is said to have walked down the start line shaking westerners hands before lining up and declaring 'men, today we die a little' as the gun went. Imo, there is not an ageing marathon runner who can't identify with that line.

[2/14/25, 6:41:12 AM] Neil Tilston: Valentine bangers?
[2/14/25, 6:45:27 AM] Neil Tilston: Liked this a lot. It's really varied and the bass playing is amazing. So many guests does make it a bit incoherent all over the place. Is the bassist the primary artist and they just work with different folk all the time? Lots of cool stuff on it for sure 👍👍
[2/14/25, 6:46:59 AM] Neil Tilston: Great to revisit an old favourite I hadn't listened to in ages. This gorgeous wall of sound of a record was on steady rotation for me 20 years ago and still sounds great. I like other records of theirs but this is a masterpiece. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
[2/14/25, 6:48:20 AM] Neil Tilston: The Cure are another legendary band but not one I've ever properly given the time to. I loved this record and really feel it helps John n to dots between the post punk era (Joy Division etc) and the more melodic post rock of mogwai. Some great sounds.
[2/14/25, 6:48:21 AM] Neil Tilston: But
[2/14/25, 6:48:36 AM] Neil Tilston: Friday in love sounds completely out of place on the record
[2/14/25, 6:49:03 AM] Neil Tilston: It's a great pop track don't get me wrong but it just sorts nds like you've put a different record on.
[2/14/25, 6:49:12 AM] Neil Tilston: Should have been a non album stand alone single
[2/14/25, 6:50:32 AM] Neil Tilston: Dave kinda nails the review on this perfectly. It's a great album with no waste and it's without a doubt the exceptional production that really makes every moment pop. With another producer this is potentially a 3/5 album but Jamie's production elevates it so much ❤️
[2/14/25, 7:56:49 AM] Rory Edwards: Yeah album as a whole is dark as hell and then you get this jaunty pop tune. Great sound overall though. Turbo influential.
[2/14/25, 7:58:50 AM] Rory Edwards: I do think this has the same problem with the outstanding opener.nkt really being what the album is about. They should have built up to it imo. Cool record overall though.
[2/14/25, 7:59:03 AM] Rory Edwards: Agree entirely with this.
[2/14/25, 7:59:16 AM] Rory Edwards: Such a musically and emotionally deep record.
[2/14/25, 8:00:34 AM] Rory Edwards: I really like this turbo varied piece as well save it's brief flapper girl moment on Tokyo Nights. Seemed to hold together despite it all. Disco snails an epic for the ages.

[2/14/25, 8:41:40 AM] David Thomas: Enjoyed all the albums in their own way this week, a varied week of picks. go to be honest, though - both The Cure and MBV struggled in comparison to the joyous, infectious gorgeousness of Vulfmon this week. There is so much fun in such simple songs. It is definitely more a collection of songs than a well-thought-out album, which is keeping with his previous stuff, but its the perfect length. (<30mins) that it works really well for me. Putting a new spin on perfect pop songs with that bass line. 5stars!

[2/17/25, 9:53:02 AM] Rory Edwards: Ah nice.
[2/17/25, 9:53:18 AM] Rory Edwards: I think it was a poster for the race before it was an album cover
[2/18/25, 7:02:05 AM] David Thomas: Really enjoyed this - much more than the last Kraftwerk album we had for some reason. Love the low key atmospheric beat - sounds both old and new - did this really come out in 2003? It sounds timeless.
[2/18/25, 7:06:38 AM] Rory Edwards: It's kind of mesmerising. A repetitive slow burn, but I think sits really well alongside doing something else, whether athletic or otherwise. When I concentrate too much on any one section I feel my brain starts to pick it to pieces as individual bloops and bleeps. Drums are really good. Also I think every grunt is just some bloke saying "keep peddling" in German.
[2/18/25, 9:18:12 AM] Fergus Neville: The single came out in 1983
[2/18/25, 9:18:58 AM] Fergus Neville: But yeah, the album seems to be 2003 (did they really need a re-master in 2009?!)
[2/18/25, 9:19:21 AM] Fergus Neville: That must be the longest length of time between single and album!
[2/18/25, 11:04:00 AM] Neil Tilston: There was a lot of really awful mastering done in the early 00s. I'm sure I've bored you all with this before 🤣 ‎<This message was edited>

[2/20/25, 11:49:46 AM] David Thomas: so this is not very good - or at least quite hard to listen to and I’ve struggled to get into it. It did lead me down a rabbit hole where i found the new King Gizzard record from last year, which is excellent - can I recommend this instead if you haven’t listened to Callous Daoboys yet?

[2/20/25, 12:35:19 PM] Rory Edwards: I saw him on this tour and it was banging. Album pretty good too, that big single absolutely slaps.
[2/20/25, 12:36:21 PM] Neil Tilston: Completely agree. It's horrendous
[2/20/25, 12:36:26 PM] Neil Tilston: Glad I wasn't the first to say
[2/20/25, 12:37:14 PM] Neil Tilston: I'm a bit behind on listening
[2/20/25, 12:37:30 PM] Neil Tilston: Partly because I keep listening to Rory's pick and having to turn it off
[2/20/25, 12:37:39 PM] Fergus Neville: Me too thankfully so I can swerve Dave's duff
[2/20/25, 12:37:39 PM] Rory Edwards: I like these guys a lot. Huge energy.  and they build through the tunes really well. It's a bit paint by numbers in places but has enough variation and doesn't stick around long enough to get boring. Really keen to catch them live. ‎<This message was edited>

[2/20/25, 12:42:41 PM] David Thomas: plus giant lizard
[2/20/25, 12:42:53 PM] Neil Tilston: Loved Sprints though. I actually have the single literary mind on 7" but for some reason hadn't got into the album . Enjoyed it much more this time around.
[2/20/25, 12:43:16 PM] Neil Tilston: Haven't got round to Roots yet

[2/26/25, 12:12:05 PM] Fergus Neville: I've also enjoyed discovering Snooks Eaglin, and also listening to Alan Toussaint today, but I think the D. John record is more diverse.
[2/26/25, 1:10:40 PM] Neil Tilston: Alan toussaint produced my pick 👍
[2/26/25, 1:13:18 PM] Neil Tilston: That Dr John album was so far ahead of it's time in 1968
[2/26/25, 1:16:34 PM] Rory Edwards: It's about time we had this album because it slaps. Big band stuff my favourite thing about New Orleans. These guys manage to capture the incredible love energy of that on record. Mildly hip hoppy bits too.
[2/27/25, 8:56:32 AM] Rory Edwards: This is batshit insane and absolutely brilliant. Like Wayne Coyne and Meg White got lost at a wind instrument museum.
[2/27/25, 9:07:22 AM] David Thomas: phew! pressure of a duff pick last week was getting to me, and i was starting to 2nd guess this one too.
[2/27/25, 9:08:30 AM] David Thomas: I didn’t know this, but it comes up in at the bottom of a lot of those lists of ‘best new orlean’s albums’ and they seem to get a lot of love from locals who’ve seen them live.
[2/27/25, 11:40:22 AM] Neil Tilston: I found it a bit tricky to be honest. Some nice ideas but the pieces felt like they were mostly still unformed. 

Felt like they were advertising a smorgasbord and plating up a "picky tea".
[2/27/25, 11:43:33 AM] David Thomas: Haha, yeah good description. I got bored of it by the end- the Brian eno style background noise tracks didn’t do anything for me
[2/27/25, 11:45:34 AM] David Thomas: Thoroughly enjoying this, beautiful sounding r&b - 16 songs in 40mins good stuff
[2/27/25, 11:46:21 AM] Rory Edwards: I was in the middle of a carnage marathon workout so I appreciated it. The whole lunch hour had degenerated into nothing in particular apart from musical twiddling, lactate and madness.

[2/27/25, 4:41:19 PM] Rory Edwards: Revenge on Edinburgh.
[2/28/25, 3:24:02 AM] Neil Tilston: Great albums this week folks. Loved Rory's pick great to have some proper brass band awesomeness in the mix. Some classic Nola funk from Betty Harris and Dr John was my favourite. You can hear clear how he influenced Tom Waits in this album. It's pure Bola put also has a really cool and mysterious aesthetic that's unique to him.

[3/1/25, 1:17:36 PM] Neil Tilston: I picked Mardi Gras. Fergus picked athletics theme before that
[3/1/25, 1:17:59 PM] Neil Tilston: Theme before that was valentine's I think
[3/1/25, 1:18:10 PM] Neil Tilston: Can't remember which of you or Rory picked that

[3/1/25, 1:18:42 PM] David Thomas: Rory's turn then.
[3/1/25, 1:19:37 PM] Fergus Neville: The White Stripes was a birthday present, he bought the Nirvana one today, and then he went through my old posters and chose Primal Scream and The Coral. Aoife rejected them all.
[3/1/25, 1:21:17 PM] David Thomas: I think screamadelica might be my favorite ever album cover - both thematically, aesthetically, musically, it’s great on all levels

[3/1/25, 4:13:40 PM] Fergus Neville: Are there any Hold Steady albums you’ve not chosen yet for nostalgia purposes?
[3/1/25, 4:14:54 PM] Rory Edwards: In bar light the Hold Steady are alright.

[3/3/25, 6:07:29 AM] Fergus Neville: I really enjoyed revisiting this record this morning. KoL became less cool/interesting as they became more mainstream, but this first record was pure swamp rock blues by _very_ young lads with an intriguing backstory. Still sounds fresh and exciting to me. I also saw them headline the Oxygen Festival in Ireland during their commercial peak, and they were far better live than I expected. ‎<This message was edited>

[3/4/25, 7:47:13 AM] David Thomas: he could have got like 5 different states out of these songs - should have just been called ‘midwest’. i like the wandering meandering feel to it with absolute bangers interspaced, but it still doesn’t quite work for me, i lose patience with it every time. its far too long, feels deliberately so and annoys me.
[3/5/25, 3:34:54 AM] Neil Tilston: Last night's opening set - "Funky Gunners play New Orleans for Mardi Gras (presented by Neil)" is now available to listen back-

https://www.mixcloud.com/jamradio/funky-gunners-040325-part-1-funky-gunners-play-new-orleans-for-mardi-gras-presented-by-neil/

Link also available in linktree in Bio/story/highlights on insta profile .

This Tuesday is Mardi Gras! This day is celebrated all over the world but no one does it like New Orleans. In carnival season the streets of New Orleans are filled with parades, music and dancing.

Neil's love of New Orleans music started when he watched the incredible HBO TV series Treme following the lives of people in post Hurricane Katrina New Orleans and featuring many real music legends including Dr John and members of The Rebirth Bras Band. Ten years ago a trip to New Orleans fuelled Neil's love for the people, place and  music from this incredible and enduring city.

Expect to hear jazz, funk, soul, brass bands and more!

[3/5/25, 10:32:30 AM] David Thomas: This is the cleanest version of this kind of album anyone’s ever made. Brit pops hidden gem (or at least passed me by at the time). Indie funk jam band stuff that brings the infectious joyousness that’s the best of Brit pop, and merges it with timeless jam band energy that gives it a freshness that still holds up, something that very little from this era can claim today.
[3/5/25, 10:46:18 AM] Fergus Neville: Hard agree with that. Like Dave, it's not really nostalgic for me though as I didn't listen to it at the time (except the saturdated radio coverage of the FBS mix of Brimful of Asha

[3/6/25, 10:27:33 AM] Fergus Neville: Is that your floor?!
[3/6/25, 10:28:12 AM] David Thomas: aye, it was hiding under a carpet in a bedroom
[3/6/25, 10:28:27 AM] David Thomas: asbestos tiles :-/
[3/6/25, 10:39:19 AM] Fergus Neville: Absolute madness
[3/6/25, 10:40:25 AM] Rory Edwards: Yeah don't break that up mate. That's the nasty stuff. Stick a new carpet down and forget about it.
[3/6/25, 10:41:20 AM] David Thomas: We got a guy who’s gonna remove it all before we move in, proper hazmat remediation stuff
[3/6/25, 10:42:15 AM] Rory Edwards: Ah fair play. It will look like the set of ET for a while I imagine. ‎<This message was edited>
[3/6/25, 10:44:27 AM] Rory Edwards: Speaking of hazmat remediation it's been a fun week here. Decked it in front of some schoolies a few weeks ago while I was out running. Grazed my knee a bit but meh, picked the bits of my ego up and roughly put them back together. Thought nothing of it.
[3/6/25, 10:44:57 AM] David Thomas: No!!!…
[3/6/25, 10:45:06 AM] Rory Edwards: Now I have an infection behind my kneecap and am currently taking antibiotics through an IV.
[3/6/25, 10:45:59 AM] David Thomas: Ooft. - that’s grim
[3/6/25, 10:47:27 AM] Rory Edwards: Been totally brutal. Just woke up in searing pain. No warning in the slightest. Apparently they've given me the good stuff though so should only take a few days.
[3/6/25, 10:49:28 AM] Rory Edwards: Totally agree with this Sex on Fire made them and ruined them in the eyes of 'serious music fans'. Myself included, I hate that tune. Imagine how cool it would have been to be at those early shows though. This record is full of swagger and bangers.
[3/6/25, 10:51:55 AM] Rory Edwards: Illinois has got to be in the top few Indie albums ever made. Brilliant compositions with the flute parts being particularly cool, deep and meaningful lyrically full of emotions and sense of place, an all time stand out tune on it as well.
[3/6/25, 10:54:32 AM] Rory Edwards: I actually think of this record in similar terms to the Kings of Leon one. Effortlessly cool and full of swagger at a time when far bigger British bands were makes bloated pish. Must have been a great show too,.did you see them @⁨Neil Tilston⁩? Shame their career never hit the big heights but we would.probabky.be fed up by.now.anyway.
[3/6/25, 10:55:39 AM] Neil Tilston: Sorry to hear that man. Take it easy and shout if you need anything
[3/6/25, 10:58:19 AM] Fergus Neville: I think Neil saw them early on and wasn't impressed. I saw them in Atlana touring Howl and it was phenomenal.
[3/6/25, 10:59:01 AM] Fergus Neville: They didn't play Whatever happend to my rock and roll though, which is exactly the sort of thing I would expect of them
[3/6/25, 10:59:18 AM] Fergus Neville: Not as bad as when I saw The Walkman and they refused to play The Rat though!
[3/6/25, 11:08:09 AM] Rory Edwards: I feel Cornershop are madly underrated. Awesome sense of melody, great fusion of Asian and British sounds. They also got famous quite slowly giving them a really deep back catalogue. This is probably their poppiest outing but is no weaker for that.
[3/6/25, 11:08:41 AM] Rory Edwards: Plus they have an album called 'Urban Turban' what's not to like?
[3/6/25, 11:09:29 AM] Rory Edwards: Thanks mate. Soon as I'm home I'm having an evening in bed listening to your New Orleans licks. ‎<This message was edited>
[3/6/25, 11:09:50 AM] Neil Tilston: They were boring AF when I saw them at the barras around 2002. Ruined them a bit for me. I played that album a lot in 1st year uni though so it fits the theme well. Also the first five things I wanted to pick had already been done!
[3/6/25, 11:10:42 AM] Neil Tilston: I like it but honestly I think they grew as a band after this. Hand cream is their masterpiece imo but a great catalogue overall from a great band and I definitely enjoyed this 👍
[3/6/25, 11:10:44 AM] Rory Edwards: I think it's a good record. Shame they didn't have it live.
[3/6/25, 11:11:03 AM] Neil Tilston: Fergus disagrees with my assessment in their defence
[3/6/25, 11:13:01 AM] Rory Edwards: I've seen mixed performances from a few bands, Primal Scream in particular.

[3/12/25, 9:39:14 AM] Rory Edwards: I like Lagunitas. You guys should try and get a collab with Big Rock Brewing. See if you can get a trip to Vancouver out of it.
[3/12/25, 9:40:47 AM] Rory Edwards: Was reflecting this morning that having never done dry January or anything like that these last ten days is probably my longest between beers in ages. Going to take that as a sign that stopping drinking only makes me feel naff.
[3/12/25, 9:41:40 AM] David Thomas: How you feeling Rory? Any blood clots yet?
[3/12/25, 9:46:32 AM] Rory Edwards: Physical I'm improving slowly mate but finding it hard mentally. Went from active every day and flying on a marathon plan to sitting on my butt when I'm not asleep. Hoping for better bloods Thursday so I can come off the hard stuff.
[3/12/25, 9:47:31 AM] Rory Edwards: Feel very tapered though 🤣
[3/12/25, 9:55:32 AM] David Thomas: Plenty of time

[3/13/25, 12:56:54 PM] David Thomas: I made the family listen to this album on a recent road trip, and they all agreed that it sounded like ‘a crappy local band you hear on the radio’ - by track three everyone was nodding along, and then everyone asked to hear their favorite track again (Virginia and Tiltawhirl)
[3/13/25, 1:01:41 PM] David Thomas: I think it’s great - super varied, fun upbeat pop at its disco-y best, but with more keyboards and horns, that flips from Florence-and-the-machine wannabe vocals straight into sickly sweet bubblegum pop punk aesthetic.
[3/13/25, 1:03:00 PM] Neil Tilston: I really enjoyed the rockier bits. Thought they were great. There were couple of times it went a bit too mainstream musical for me and started to remind me of frozen/wicked.
[3/13/25, 1:03:07 PM] David Thomas: Some super naive but charming lyrics that could be aweful that thread the line between being cringy or silly
[3/13/25, 1:03:50 PM] Neil Tilston: Bizarrely it actually reminded me of come on feel the Illinoise in places. Anyone else? ‎<This message was edited>

[3/15/25, 4:34:09 AM] Rory Edwards: Just to say I really like Saul William but his stuff is insanely lyrically dense. I think you could write a thesis on pretty much each tune 'Saul Williams Penny For a Thought and the impact of religious tradition and family dynamics in shaping black spiritual and community identity' etc.
[3/15/25, 4:34:32 AM] Rory Edwards: It means I can only ever do a few tunes at a time without having to go back.

[3/19/25, 7:10:05 AM] Neil Tilston: It's a slow burner but it's class. The wire of the 2020s
[3/19/25, 7:11:52 AM] Fergus Neville: Really makes me want a beer though
[3/19/25, 7:48:23 AM] David Thomas: Me too! It’s not often an album about excess drinking actually makes you want to have a beer and a smoke
[3/19/25, 7:51:46 AM] David Thomas: Feels a little like they’ve mellowed with age and have lost a little bit of the edge that they had with the “Celebration Rock” album
[3/19/25, 7:55:17 AM] David Thomas: think his voice has lost that screamo-light sound and sounds more like The Weakerthans than Laura Jane Grace here
[3/19/25, 7:55:51 AM] David Thomas: Almost decemberists levels of indie rock

[3/26/25, 7:51:16 AM] David Thomas: Really enjoyed the three picks other than Goldie - I knew that i'd struggle with this on from previous attempts to listen  - the other three albums were so upbeat and energetic, and then the melancholy of Goldie just made it hard to switch into.
[3/26/25, 7:52:00 AM] David Thomas: Not doubting that it’s musically great, just not for me.
[3/26/25, 7:55:12 AM] David Thomas: The other three albums played back to back blurred into a mosh of nonsense, in the best possible way- great beats to work along to and to turn up load on the train/ in the car. Great theme, which I thought I’d struggle with, but turns out I really like ‘new gen jungalist’ - either that or we all ignore the theme and picked techno/rave.

[3/28/25, 4:34:10 PM] Rory Edwards: This week's theme is 'ideas'. We're doing concept albums.
[3/28/25, 4:34:44 PM] Rory Edwards: Trigger warning etc. Give this album a listen: The Downward Spiral

[3/28/25, 4:55:26 PM] David Thomas: “The Most Lamentable Tragedy, a 29-track, 93-minute rock opera …. The Most Lamentable Tragedy is a story told in five acts that follows the Hero, an unnamed man (who's someone like Stickles) in an unnamed city (which is somewhere like New York) grappling with his neuroses. He's confronted by his doppelgänger—an alternate self that seems to have everything figured out, and pushes him to find solace outside of sin. It’s a protracted allegory for manic depression.”
[3/28/25, 4:55:57 PM] David Thomas: 👍😊🤗😋
[3/28/25, 5:08:04 PM] Rory Edwards: This sounds like the plot of a China Mieville novel.
[3/28/25, 5:08:12 PM] Rory Edwards: I like it.
[3/28/25, 6:13:30 PM] Neil Tilston: I'm going to fucking hate this
[3/28/25, 6:13:35 PM] Neil Tilston: 🤣
[3/28/25, 7:43:31 PM] Fergus Neville: The last Titus Andronicus is possibly my all time favourite album club pick

[3/28/25, 8:37:49 PM] David Thomas: Listened on a 3.5hr flight. Completely ridiculous. At times downright awful, but with a heartbeat running through it that threatens to break out into soaringly good - which at times it does, but I forget which parts because it’s so so dense.

That pogues cover seems to come out of nowhere!
[3/31/25, 2:54:49 AM] Neil Tilston: By the way this crowd are Greek. 🇬🇷Our first Greek entry in album club? Anyhoo one of the driving forces in the band was the keyboard player Vangelis who went on to compose film scores including Blade Runner and Chariots Of Fire.
[4/1/25, 1:52:29 AM] Neil Tilston: Got an album @⁨Fergus Neville⁩ ?
[4/1/25, 8:36:27 AM] Fergus Neville: Set 500 years in the future, here is the 3rd in Richard Dawson's trilogy of "concept albums" (Peasant - past, 2020 - present, Ruby Cord - future). In this record, humans are "somewhere between the world we know and a virtual space in which the lines between history, mythology and imagination blur".
[4/1/25, 8:37:17 AM] Fergus Neville: In case there were any doubt whether this was a concept album, the opening track is 41 mins. Longest single track so far on album club? 🤓

[4/2/25, 9:21:04 AM] Fergus Neville: Wasn't Rory's theme wanky records?
[4/2/25, 9:21:42 AM] Fergus Neville: By definition a concept album has to be unfathomly bloated
[4/2/25, 9:57:07 AM] David Thomas: Enjoying the rest of the album, I just didn’t get anything out of the hermit, and am reluctant to try again
[4/2/25, 10:08:16 AM] Neil Tilston: I've listened to and enjoyed the first three albums!
[4/2/25, 10:08:17 AM] Neil Tilston: Haven't yet found the desire for a 41 minute song
[4/2/25, 10:08:17 AM] Neil Tilston: I'll get there eventually
[4/2/25, 11:01:36 AM] Fergus Neville: I've not listened to it yet either tbf 😆
[4/2/25, 11:02:31 AM] Rory Edwards: It helps that a good bit of it isn't really a song. More ambient noise that suggests it could become a song at anytime. That said it was quite enjoyable.
[4/2/25, 12:32:41 PM] David Thomas: This is delightfully bananas
[4/2/25, 12:47:19 PM] David Thomas: Had to check that this was still the same album - could easily be PBS or something modern - https://open.spotify.com/track/3CWTsjolLdfySLnGD9dwwj?si=xkBqbJUjTp-LgF4rCMnDfQ&context=spotify%3Aalbum%3A2lWDphDAlgk8PNdODreJwv
[4/2/25, 1:59:11 PM] David Thomas: Thought it was great - super up beat, interesting, fun. Great first day back at work album to pick me up
[4/2/25, 5:35:30 PM] Fergus Neville: Personally, I really enjoyed this. It's a RD album I'd never really taken the time to listen to, but it sounded epic to my ears tonight. I'm told it's worth reading the lyrics to fully appreciate the futaristic dystopian world he's created, but I might save that for another day.
[4/2/25, 5:35:49 PM] Fergus Neville: I'm very excited to see him play in the summer, although it might be a tough sell for Dee and the kids.
[4/3/25, 5:34:39 AM] Neil Tilston: Have to be honest I don't think I'm a fan of RD. Guy sings like he's constantly bursting for a piss. ‎<This message was edited>
[4/3/25, 6:25:30 AM] Fergus Neville: An awful take, but that is quite a good line.
[4/3/25, 11:23:13 AM] Rory Edwards: This was my highlight of the week despite it being fairly batshit/a normal Tuesday for an American Evangelical. Full marks for the true to Biblical description (ie terrifying) angel choir.
[4/3/25, 11:24:30 AM] Rory Edwards: The decision to make 'Apocolyptica' mean something totally different in English to Greek has a lot to answer for.
[4/3/25, 11:25:13 AM] Rory Edwards: That said probably understood more of it than at least two of the other albums.

[4/4/25, 4:31:46 PM] Rory Edwards: Here's a late and overrated banger on previous theme. https://open.spotify.com/track/6LbbHFEajG9e4m0G3L47c4?si=VAhMHs0nSuKAaHRV0LAcHw&context=spotify%3Aalbum%3A5cT7ee1sy2oEbFalP4asS4
[4/4/25, 4:34:28 PM] Rory Edwards: Titus Andronicus was quite the ride. It's almost like a tribute to The Monitor, did they share some track names, have a similar structure? I think they almost pulled it off again but not quite. The Monitor still one of my favourite AC discoveries.
[4/4/25, 4:36:43 PM] Rory Edwards: The Downward Spiral made Nine Inch Nails turbo famous which is crazy given how heavy it is, ending with a single gun shot. Rhythm work is incredible and sounds almost produced rather than played, perhaps a prelude tow hat Reznor does most of nowadays. You won't get a better album in that niche imo. Bit long though, could spiral quicker.
[4/4/25, 4:37:57 PM] Rory Edwards: Quite liked the Ruby Chord and mean to read over the lyrics. Had a cinematic quality, less music and more ambient noise in places particularly the opener. The vocal doesn't really suit me either but still and experience
[4/4/25, 4:38:15 PM] Rory Edwards: Last couple of weeks have been a bit mad but made for some varied and enjoyable listening.
[4/4/25, 4:44:22 PM] Neil Tilston: Ken it's pish right

[4/7/25, 12:18:00 PM] Fergus Neville: Was driving with my Dad and Finlay to go mountain biking and we discussed ideas for this. Finlay’s Primal Scream suggestion was a good one, but we’ve had it. Which leaves us with my Dad’s pick. Said he saw them live in the 70s and they were ace. A new listen for me too so apologies if it’s honking.

[4/9/25, 3:18:16 AM] Fergus Neville: I'm making a music quiz for the Business School PhD Retreat. Any ideas welcome! I'm worried no-one will have heard of half of my choices.
[4/9/25, 3:18:26 AM] Fergus Neville: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5n4R0om5H8C1lbZNDmyRrK?si=eb05c336c6fc4748
[4/9/25, 3:20:04 AM] Neil Tilston: Ok as a former quiz master I have some thoughts...
[4/9/25, 3:20:20 AM] Fergus Neville: here we fucking go...
[4/9/25, 3:20:24 AM] Neil Tilston: I assume the format is you play the intro and they guess both artist and track
[4/9/25, 3:20:54 AM] Fergus Neville: Yeah probably. I'll play them at least until the chorus with the song title kicks in if applicable
[4/9/25, 3:21:04 AM] Neil Tilston: So my advice is put an easy track on first that most teams will know (ie dolly first?)
[4/9/25, 3:21:45 AM] Neil Tilston: Also that's a lot of tracks if a team is struggling/finding it hard they're going to be ruined by the end. Maybe cut it down to 10 or so?
[4/9/25, 3:21:46 AM] Fergus Neville: Yeah I thought Pink Floyd was quite easy, but Dolly is even easier I suppose
[4/9/25, 3:22:18 AM] Neil Tilston: Is everyone at the retreat 40-70 years old ? If not that pink Floyd track is harder than you think
[4/9/25, 3:22:38 AM] Fergus Neville: Yes I'll cut it down. Might also split it into different parts with other rounds in between. The longer I spend on the music quiz the less I have to spend actually teaching them things though.
[4/9/25, 3:23:06 AM] Neil Tilston: Also you need some tunes from the last ten years. You've a good mix of genres but it's missing pop
[4/9/25, 3:23:19 AM] Neil Tilston: You probably need some Taylor/Charli xcx
[4/9/25, 3:23:36 AM] Fergus Neville: As ever, the main objective of the quiz is to demonstrate how much more I know about music than they do (at least the music I listen to, not the music they listen to which obviously doesn't count)
[4/9/25, 3:23:48 AM] Neil Tilston: Do you want it to be fun for you or fun for them?
[4/9/25, 3:23:49 AM] Fergus Neville: There is some Taylor
[4/9/25, 3:24:02 AM] Fergus Neville: Feel free to suggest newer stuff which is relevant
[4/9/25, 3:24:12 AM] Neil Tilston: Beg your pardon
[4/9/25, 3:25:30 AM] Neil Tilston: I mean you're literally just showing off with PSB, anhoni, and woody Guthrie.
[4/9/25, 3:25:50 AM] Neil Tilston: Also unnecessarily obscure Bruce Springsteen and beastie boys tracks - pick a hit
[4/9/25, 3:26:16 AM] Fergus Neville: Yeah, but they need to relate to business/management/finance/economics in some way
[4/9/25, 3:26:31 AM] Neil Tilston: Oh right
[4/9/25, 3:26:37 AM] Neil Tilston: Fun
[4/9/25, 3:26:41 AM] Fergus Neville: the Springsteen is John Henry - classic song about the struggle of the working class
[4/9/25, 3:26:50 AM] Fergus Neville: It's a Business School PhD retreat
[4/9/25, 3:26:54 AM] Neil Tilston: I know what it is!
[4/9/25, 3:27:08 AM] Neil Tilston: The John Henry song I mean
[4/9/25, 3:28:37 AM] Fergus Neville: Rory looked to be writing a _long_ message there, then presumably feared Neil's wrath and gave up
[4/9/25, 3:29:07 AM] Neil Tilston: Did you ask for thoughts and then get annoyed that I told you them?
[4/9/25, 3:29:39 AM] Fergus Neville: They were mostly good thoughts. Although it became clear that you didn't understand the purpose of the quiz having torn into it.
[4/9/25, 3:29:50 AM] Neil Tilston: You literally said yourself you were worried that people wouldn't know them
[4/9/25, 3:30:02 AM] Rory Edwards: I had a lot of fun with a round at a music quiz recently when you had to name a tune on a given theme one team at a time to build a chain.
[4/9/25, 3:30:03 AM] Neil Tilston: And I told you that you were right to be worried about that
[4/9/25, 3:30:09 AM] Rory Edwards: When it got to your table you could either take half the points and stop the chain, or name another tune.
[4/9/25, 3:30:24 AM] Rory Edwards: If the next team couldn't name a tune you got all the points.
[4/9/25, 3:30:34 AM] Fergus Neville: Calm down I'm joking 😆 It's too long and obscure and I'll cut the long list down significantly
[4/9/25, 3:30:35 AM] Rory Edwards: Everyone got a point for the tunes they named.
[4/9/25, 3:31:02 AM] Fergus Neville: That sounds fun, if potentially complicated. I like it though.
[4/9/25, 3:31:19 AM] Rory Edwards: I can totally understand the need for validation before making a mess of everyone's retreat social evening
[4/9/25, 3:31:44 AM] Rory Edwards: The first one was a mess then people got the hang of it.
[4/9/25, 3:32:12 AM] Fergus Neville: So the punters name the tunes rather than the quizmaster?
[4/9/25, 3:33:40 AM] Rory Edwards: Yeah, one table after another. So theme is weather - Thunderstruck, Why does it always rain on me... next table names a tune and hopes the next can't, or takes a point...
[4/9/25, 3:34:36 AM] Fergus Neville: That does sound good. Do you get to listen to the music though?
[4/9/25, 3:49:26 AM] Rory Edwards: Nah, just each other.
[4/9/25, 3:50:49 AM] Rory Edwards: One last thing to mention is that you have to repeat the whole chain before you guess. Otherwise the team before wins. So if you're team 10 you're remembering none tunes.
[4/9/25, 3:51:16 AM] Rory Edwards: Anyway I'm making this sound much more complicated than it is. Good luck x
[4/9/25, 5:05:05 AM] Neil Tilston: Why have you picked juicy rather than mo money mo problems for Biggie? Surely the second is more suitable for the theme? ‎<This message was edited>
[4/9/25, 5:24:11 AM] Neil Tilston: If you want more hip hop then how about CREAM (Cash rules everything around me) by Wu tang?
[4/9/25, 5:24:11 AM] Neil Tilston: Also for The Beatles I'd say Money (That's what I want) has a more iconic intro imo
[4/9/25, 5:45:06 AM] Fergus Neville: There’s a radio friendly version of Juicy and I thought more people would know it! But if there’s a Mo Money one too that would be good.

[4/9/25, 7:21:06 AM] Neil Tilston: Think there's a new one just out
[4/9/25, 7:42:14 AM] Rory Edwards: Yeah algorithm recommended it and that's what I jumped off of.

[4/9/25, 9:08:50 AM] Rory Edwards: Drum Farm antiques. They have whole shipping containers full of old vinyl.
[4/9/25, 9:28:13 AM] Neil Tilston: Anything good?
[4/9/25, 9:31:01 AM] Rory Edwards: Not so far but I feel there's potential
[4/9/25, 9:34:47 AM] David Thomas: This gives me anxiety. I would genuinely have to walk straight out

[4/11/25, 2:00:11 PM] Rory Edwards: Dinnae get the love in for this. First track is good. Prog has got to be one of the only genres I get even less since album club's inception. I should probably take more drugs.
[4/11/25, 2:01:43 PM] Rory Edwards: Supergrass are very good and probably a bit underrated. Perhaps they just don't have enough to say, but doesn't mean they don't make great tunes which this record is full of.
[4/11/25, 2:05:36 PM] Rory Edwards: This is certainly a Wheatus record. Great for when you're unpacking a box and don't want to be distracted by anything too clever.

[4/11/25, 2:28:41 PM] Neil Tilston: Great band but in truth a great singles band as this album (and all of them prove) the other tracks are absolutely fine but the hits are the standouts
[4/11/25, 2:28:50 PM] Fergus Neville: Do you understand the theme of the quiz yet Neil?
[4/11/25, 2:29:14 PM] Neil Tilston: Something to do with corporate capitalist awfulness

[4/11/25, 6:12:45 PM] Fergus Neville: 13.5/40 which I think makes me the winner
[4/11/25, 6:13:26 PM] Fergus Neville: Table tennis, pool and alcohol seem to be the priority now so the confusion and exasperation of the music quiz are long behind us

[4/13/25, 3:57:21 AM] Fergus Neville: I considered this thinking I could pick Hail to the Thief which has Drunken Punchup at a Wedding, but we’ve already had it
[4/13/25, 3:57:52 AM] Fergus Neville: Instead, go for an album which has been recommended to you by someone outside the group, preferably something you’ve not heard yet.
[4/13/25, 4:00:04 AM] Fergus Neville: An American Country singer called Michael Hurley died last week, and James Yorkston wrote a lovely post about how much he loved his weird music and his friendship with him. I’d never heard of MH and so asked JY for a recommendation of where to start. He suggested this:

Rowan who is the front man of local folk band Jerry Fabin did a really great show on JAM radio last week. The show was designed as an introduction to blues and folk based on Rowan's collection. It was a really excellent show and this is one of the albums he spoke about .

[4/15/25, 6:51:21 AM] David Thomas: Occasionally album club albums can feel a little like a chore - usually at least one a week that  have no interest in listening to - but this week all 3 of your picks look great!
[4/15/25, 6:52:32 AM] Neil Tilston: If you don't know which album is the chore...
[4/15/25, 6:58:42 AM] David Thomas: Fair
[4/15/25, 7:00:07 AM] Fergus Neville: I've only listened to Michael Hurley and Davy Graham so far, but enjoyed both immensely
[4/15/25, 7:02:28 AM] Fergus Neville: The White Stripes do a cracking version of the Seven Gypsies track that Davy Graham plays. The lyrics are a bit different, but it's the same melody and theme.

[4/15/25, 7:05:40 AM] David Thomas: Michael Hurley is delightful. Like a pleasant leadbelly
[4/15/25, 7:33:55 AM] Neil Tilston: I feel Rory's pick was important to stop it just being a folk week
[4/15/25, 9:32:09 AM] Rory Edwards: Good to hear the bloke from The Mountain Goats is taking his meds.
[4/15/25, 3:48:21 PM] David Thomas: This is also great, but why is he so cheery?
[4/15/25, 4:11:39 PM] Neil Tilston: Tbh I'd say he's a 6/10 singer but a 10/10 guitar player
[4/17/25, 4:34:58 AM] Neil Tilston: It's been about ten years since a pitchfork article struck a chord with me but this one did -

[4/17/25, 4:42:57 AM] Rory Edwards: In fairness if Bezos was looking to make a statement with his dosh he needed someone who could put the performance in performative - who better than Katy Perry?
[4/17/25, 4:47:40 AM] Neil Tilston: In fairness to Katy Perry it says a lot about society that people are turning their anger on her rather than Bezos
[4/17/25, 4:51:52 AM] Rory Edwards: Yeah that's fair. Her lack of self awareness isn't helping her but the vast majority would surely have taken the ticket. That said, the whole thing is bizarre and smacks of Nero to me.

[4/25/25, 1:51:43 AM] Rory Edwards: Yep, bit of a telt.
[4/25/25, 1:51:57 AM] Rory Edwards: I thought this week's music was great.
[4/25/25, 1:53:22 AM] Rory Edwards: Have heard UNKLE tunes but have never listened to this. Like a Sith version of the Avalanches. Had that brilliant thing of being full of ideas but still holding together.
[4/25/25, 1:55:27 AM] Rory Edwards: Jazz and country come together with a unique vocal in a slick and emotional MOBO reflection on home. Preferred it on the country end until it restarted in my Spotify and I heard the jazzier openers
[4/25/25, 1:58:33 AM] Rory Edwards: The world's most horizontal protest album. The laconic Reggae groove gives it cool while the jazz overtones and satirical lyrics give it bite. A touch long for me when I'm not up to something else but amazing BBQ background which it was for us.
[4/25/25, 1:59:02 AM] Rory Edwards: Not quite under the skin of this yet but it sounds great and has another brilliant vocal.
[4/25/25, 2:08:46 AM] Rory Edwards: My head went to mashups with bangers and I picked this one with a ridiculous BPM https://open.spotify.com/track/0N0UGTv0UO1b6Um3TTbRXE?si=9cIbytHZTvCvqosXgCKIJA

[4/25/25, 3:24:39 AM] Neil Tilston: I picked this album and theme after watching the excellent doc "The Man from Mo Wax" all about James Lavelle and his incredible record label. This album is at the epicenter of the story. In truth it's really DJ shadow's solo album but I'd highly recommend watching the film and seeing how James and Shadow go from enthusiastic collaborators to Shadow loathing James for taking credit for what was basically his album. An incredible record and unsurprisingly UNKLE never replicated it (although they do have some killer tunes) because their primary artist left after one album!
[4/25/25, 3:26:21 AM] Neil Tilston: I found this an interesting album her voice is quite striking and on some tunes I thought it was truly awesome and on others I found it a little annoying. Not really sure where I landed in the end tbh. An interesting pick for sure and a good bl Nd of sounds and genres .
[4/25/25, 3:30:59 AM] Neil Tilston: A fantastic record. It's easy to write UB40 off as music for middle aged middle class dinner parties because of how big some of those popier covers they did later were so massive. But early UB40 and this album in particular show that at their best UB40 were right up there with the likes of The Specials for making music that was at once English and also Carribbean fully showcasing the incredible artistic influence of the windrush generation in British music. I'd argue this record contains some of the greatest dub tracks ever recorded outside of Jamaica 

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
[4/25/25, 3:31:53 AM] Neil Tilston: Similar to Rory I enjoyed the style of this. Very cinematic and in places it had a nice retro feel that reminded me of dusty in Memphis. Would need to listen more to find out if it has more to it that I missed on first spin.
[4/25/25, 3:32:03 AM] Neil Tilston: Thanks everyone for your picks !
[4/25/25, 3:50:35 AM] Rory Edwards: I know what you mean and did think she overdid it sometimes but I settled on it being very good overall.
[4/25/25, 3:51:15 AM] Rory Edwards: Wasn't aware of the story particularly but you can hear DJ Shadow all over it.

[4/25/25, 9:05:43 AM] Neil Tilston: It's his album. James' contribution was literally arranging the collaborators

[4/25/25, 10:18:44 AM] David Thomas: I get this is technically very good album, but its just not my jam, or at least I wasn’t in the mood for shadow’s metallic melancholy sounds. its a sunny spring day, and i want to be outside, and richard ashcroft whining on about being on his tod is just too grim for me.
[4/25/25, 10:20:08 AM] Neil Tilston: Fair enough man. Listen to it another time
[4/25/25, 10:20:34 AM] Neil Tilston: One of the handy things about music like this is it has a pause button and you can choose the time and place!
[4/25/25, 10:20:40 AM] Neil Tilston: 😂
[4/25/25, 10:23:10 AM] David Thomas: aye, fair enough.
[4/25/25, 10:23:32 AM] David Thomas: its just a really dense dark sound - what makes him so good often makes me not want to listen
[4/25/25, 10:24:06 AM] Fergus Neville: I liked it!
[4/25/25, 10:24:07 AM] David Thomas: always slightly unnerving - the strings etc

[4/25/25, 10:42:20 AM] David Thomas: Excellent stuff
[4/25/25, 11:09:02 AM] Neil Tilston: This is like Sleaford mods folk album
[4/25/25, 11:12:52 AM] David Thomas: thought this was really great - totally got stuck in my head, and listened back to back a bunch of times. can’t quite put my finger on why it sounds so unique, but think she’s just hit the exact tone in that dreamy retro folk but something to say style that i’ve wanted to like in a bunch of artists - laura marling, angel olsen etc - but tend to get bored of before i get into the albums.
[4/25/25, 11:13:32 AM] David Thomas: pitchfork says ‘she favors the verse over the chorus’ - maybe this is why - more depth to the tracks, that you don’t need to listen super hard to enjoy all the sounds, but sounds fresh on every listen
[4/25/25, 11:15:15 AM] David Thomas: yes! they’re really good, but hit that ‘too annoying to enjoy’ note pretty quickly - have nearly picked their album a few times, but honestly is a bit much

[4/28/25, 11:59:20 AM] Neil Tilston: We should use this as the poster for the next big rock gig @⁨Fergus Neville⁩ . That'll get those last few tickets sold!

[5/2/25, 3:07:31 AM] Rory Edwards: Free choice bangers - freedom of speech innit.

[5/2/25, 3:15:30 AM] Neil Tilston: It feels like our world has shifted so far to the right that even in Scotland, which I've always been proud to believe is more progressive than our English and American counterparts, the first minister thinks he can dictate which acts get to play their music and share their art and opinions.
[5/2/25, 3:16:22 AM] Neil Tilston: Fuck Swinney and his faux outrage at the rise of the right. Tartan Tory bastards
[5/2/25, 3:22:13 AM] Fergus Neville: I actually managed to think of a duo banger so will stick with that
[5/2/25, 3:22:18 AM] Fergus Neville: https://open.spotify.com/track/2tSQLJEofFdWIHSks5p0ii?si=w1becJwaTumSgr3lsy-OEw
[5/2/25, 3:27:35 AM] Rory Edwards: ...about politics.
[5/2/25, 3:27:54 AM] Fergus Neville: I agree with this completely, but it’s also true that with freedom of speech comes responsibility.  I respect artists who voice options which are different from mine, but freedom of speech doesn’t mean that you can say anything (that’s the Musk et al viewpoint). This is why hate speech etc is rightly illegal. Kneecap were daft to say the line about killing MPs as  that does cross a line in my opinion. I appreciate it was probably a) taken out of context, b) only unearthed to smear them because of their support for Gaza, and c) that politicians certainly shouldn’t be dictating musical lineups. But you can’t call for political violence in public and expect to laugh it off imo.
[5/2/25, 3:31:40 AM] Neil Tilston: I agree up to a point but this already exists in so much music eg

Mogwai - George Square Margaret Thatcher Death Party
Run the jewels - Kill your masters
Nwa - fuck the police

If we let politicians take lines out of context all of those acts and thousands more can be justifiably canned if it suits the narrative
[5/2/25, 3:32:18 AM] Neil Tilston: I (and kneecap) clearly don't support violence. But metaphor exists in art and that's why context for these things is so important
[5/2/25, 3:33:49 AM] Neil Tilston: I agree that TRNSMT have every right to cancel their booking of kneecap if they feel they don't align with their values. But I strongly feel it's none of the FM's business
[5/2/25, 3:34:27 AM] Neil Tilston: And the police can and should investigate if they feel the activity could be criminal
[5/2/25, 3:34:54 AM] Fergus Neville: Agree with that (although the Mogwai example is different imo). But I wouldn’t be happy with an artists who had proclaimed on stage to “kill all black people, the only good black person is a dead one”. So it’s important to have the same standard when it’s a different group being attacked.
[5/2/25, 3:35:55 AM] Rory Edwards: Race does not equal politics for me @⁨Fergus Neville⁩
[5/2/25, 3:35:57 AM] Fergus Neville: It’s also very true that this stuff is only coming out because they’re being targeted by their high profile criticisms of Israel
[5/2/25, 3:36:36 AM] Neil Tilston: I wouldn't be happy either and I certainly wouldn't support that artist. But I'd let the bookers make their own decisions and the police do their job. Swinney is only weighing in because other politicians are and he wants to feel important. And they're weighing in because of their complicity in the genocide.
[5/2/25, 3:37:35 AM] Fergus Neville: Swap the same line for Liberal Democrats or whoever then. It’s rightly illegal to call for political violence. I don’t think they meant it - it was a joke - but they’ve needlessly left themselves open to to attack imo which risks discrediting their other views/music which is a shame.
[5/2/25, 3:37:40 AM] Neil Tilston: I have never supported the non platforming of right wing opinions. Let them speak. Disagree with them.
[5/2/25, 3:40:12 AM] Rory Edwards: Fine, it wouldn't particularly bother me. I'm not saying it should be allowed necessarily, but people make those sort of proclamations of political violence against left wingers all the time and nothing is done.
[5/2/25, 3:41:05 AM] Rory Edwards: Climate protestors should 'all be hanged' cause some people don't get to work on time or whatever. ‎<This message was edited>

[5/2/25, 5:29:55 AM] David Thomas: I think I’m more of a free speech supporter than musk et al, who don’t really believe it one bit but just want to say mean shit
[5/2/25, 5:36:27 AM] David Thomas: I think artists being prosecuted for lyrics or even something they say when on stage as part of a persona - the boy wears a Bally for fuck sack - is something we should push back on, no matter the point of view, especially when it’s so obviously politically motivated. We’ve lived through at least two ‘satanic panics’ targeting actual music that I can think of. Anyone who thinks kneecap’s words are going to lead to actual violence is full of pish. No more than call of duty has any link to school shooters.

[5/8/25, 1:25:19 PM] Rory Edwards: Are there perchance more people of Catholic origin in your group chats than mine? A mystery imo 🤣 ‎<This message was edited>
[5/8/25, 1:26:03 PM] David Thomas: Yeah! Suprised it was the American. That specific American can only be good news for the us Catholic Church  imho.
[5/8/25, 1:26:17 PM] Neil Tilston: It must be because I picked kneecap
[5/8/25, 1:26:17 PM] David Thomas: Pope of the workers pal
[5/8/25, 1:26:21 PM] David Thomas: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Leo_XIII

[5/8/25, 4:44:56 PM] Rory Edwards: He joins a fine line of Popes who look a bit like Palpatine.

[5/9/25, 10:23:20 AM] Rory Edwards: A classic imo.
[5/9/25, 10:24:18 AM] Rory Edwards: Really liked all today's bangers actually.
[5/9/25, 10:24:46 AM] David Thomas: Quietly drops absolute banger from unheard of 2000s ska band - what singles club was made for
[5/9/25, 10:25:54 AM] Rory Edwards: Enjoyed this a lot. Urgent stuff. Like punk should be. Felt a bit beat up after.
[5/9/25, 10:27:32 AM] Rory Edwards: Really like how this album makes clear how politics impacts the personal. The hard lines land because so much of it is delivered with a wet smile.
[5/9/25, 10:28:00 AM] Rory Edwards: But why do people do this?
[5/9/25, 10:28:57 AM] Rory Edwards: Actually think this follows a similar vein. Prefer the production on this but the flow on the other.
[5/9/25, 10:29:47 AM] Rory Edwards: Listening to both records together made me wonder if the trick to creating a vocal base of activists is 'more drugs,'
[5/9/25, 10:30:45 AM] Rory Edwards: @⁨Fergus Neville⁩ managed to pick two great records this week. Unprecedented stuff 🤣
[5/9/25, 10:37:52 AM] David Thomas: Skanking for the win

[5/9/25, 4:32:05 PM] David Thomas: Two tone Ferg

[5/11/25, 6:41:53 AM] Rory Edwards: Only got funding for it till the end of the year otherwise.

[5/13/25, 10:45:44 AM] David Thomas: This is great. Did someone pick this for singles before?
[5/13/25, 10:53:42 AM] Neil Tilston: I think I picked hitchikers guide to the fallacy
[5/13/25, 11:08:37 AM] Fergus Neville: Glad you're all enjoying it. I've played it through multiple times now. Can't wait to see hime live.
[5/15/25, 3:44:21 PM] Rory Edwards: Like the moody bass that underpins this. Extremely in your face lyrically, leaving the personal right out there. Not really my thing but think it deserves the plaudits.
[5/15/25, 3:44:43 PM] Rory Edwards: Nissan Altima a total banger.
[5/15/25, 3:45:20 PM] Neil Tilston: My only criticism is she left her best track off the album

[5/15/25, 5:28:24 PM] David Thomas: Not really my thing either. But enjoyed nearly all of it - extremely hit or miss, like every other rap album, but when she’s good she great. Versatile, funny, mixed influences, minimal skits, 5stars
[5/15/25, 5:29:04 PM] Neil Tilston: I thought it was banging
[5/15/25, 5:29:05 PM] Neil Tilston: Possible 5 stars
[5/15/25, 5:57:37 PM] Rory Edwards: This tune is all over IG etc. It is indeed a banger.
[5/15/25, 6:02:18 PM] David Thomas: All over Friday bangers like three weeks ago you mean
[5/16/25, 3:33:01 AM] Rory Edwards: I'm sure that's right 🤣
[5/16/25, 3:33:27 AM] Rory Edwards: Vic Galloway deserves a medal for pronouncing the name of that weird festival in Newport on Tay correctly.
[5/16/25, 3:36:00 AM] Neil Tilston: Press kit includes phonetic version this year
[5/16/25, 3:38:53 AM] Rory Edwards: Ha! Wise.
[5/16/25, 3:45:38 AM] Rory Edwards: This was cool too. Jazzy, layered and personal. Chilled vibe so you could dive in and out but was more rewarding the more you listened.
[5/16/25, 3:45:40 AM] Rory Edwards: Hope folk liked my piano driven, vaguely dancy, chilout record. The closest comparison I can think of is Aphex Twins but it's not quite that either
[5/16/25, 3:54:07 AM] Neil Tilston: Meant to mention Joe Rattary is th bassist

[5/18/25, 3:40:37 AM] Neil Tilston: I notice that when given free choice last week we all picked 2025 records. And we've not done that as often as we sometimes do so I suspect there's lots more good records from this year still to be shared. So that's the theme 2025 albums...

[5/21/25, 8:11:22 AM] David Thomas: I see Neil’s picked a banger (giantess) for the album club playlist, so hopefully that’s a good sign that other folks will like it too
[5/21/25, 8:12:30 AM] David Thomas: He’s one half of The Felice Brothers, who Connor Oberst uses as a traveling band when he tours.

[5/25/25, 5:03:24 AM] Fergus Neville: @⁨Rory Edwards⁩ Am I allowed to pick the new Kathryn Joseph album which doesn’t come out until Friday, or would that cause outrage, acrimony and more whining than is dignified for 40-something men?
[5/25/25, 5:03:42 AM] Neil Tilston: You can pick it next week
[5/25/25, 5:03:48 AM] Neil Tilston: When we could listen to it
[5/25/25, 5:04:35 AM] Fergus Neville: There might be a different theme next week, and Friday is part of this week. Shut your pus and let the theme-picker answer the question.
[5/25/25, 5:04:50 AM] Fergus Neville: If Rory’s not having it then fair enough
[5/25/25, 5:04:59 AM] Fergus Neville: 😛
[5/25/25, 9:31:25 AM] David Thomas: I think Ferg’s got a good point. Barry can’t swim’s new album comes out mid July, so I’m picking that one.
[5/25/25, 9:35:28 AM] Fergus Neville: Can’t argue with that logic 👍
[5/25/25, 1:32:43 PM] David Thomas: @⁨Rory Edwards⁩ great work Rory - looked like a brutal finish,  but super proud of you for finishing that one out!xx
[5/25/25, 1:41:30 PM] Fergus Neville: My neighbour also did the Edinburgh marathon today, and needed to be carried over the line semi-conscious
[5/25/25, 1:50:54 PM] David Thomas: Ooft
[5/25/25, 2:00:45 PM] Rory Edwards: I booked hard and had black walls closing in. Awful running conditions so proud to finish in the end, especially as I had to put myself back together.
[5/25/25, 2:01:21 PM] Rory Edwards: My finish was partly save by a mate with three sub three finishes dropping out and giving me his remaining salt.
[5/25/25, 2:01:29 PM] Rory Edwards: Hope your neighbour is ok. I have never seen so many quick people drop out.
[5/25/25, 2:02:10 PM] Rory Edwards: But I still can't let you pick an album for Friday bangers.
[5/25/25, 2:05:16 PM] David Thomas: What was the conditions, windy?
[5/25/25, 2:07:48 PM] Rory Edwards: Hot and blowing a gale in your face for the back third. My main problem was the bonk though.

[5/28/25, 7:49:10 AM] David Thomas: Have no interest in seeing this film, but the soundtrack is lovely
[5/28/25, 2:16:55 PM] David Thomas: Gave this a couple of listens, but found it a bit insipid - was expecting more from Paulo.
[5/28/25, 2:30:56 PM] Neil Tilston: It's my favourite Paulo album. It doesn't have his biggest hits by any means but as a record I love the heavy soul feel of it. Makes for a great coherent album listen imo!
[5/28/25, 2:31:45 PM] Neil Tilston: I do think this is an ace record. There's a handful of exceptionally strong tracks in it that are particularly impressive.
[5/28/25, 2:33:21 PM] Neil Tilston: I'd never listened to any of this before. I only really know the heaven and las Vegas album and the pearly dew drops single. Tbh I don't think this is as good as that but found it interesting to hear how they clearly started as much more of a post punk act influenced by Siouxie and the banshees but it's interesting to hear their signature sound under the surface. Glad you picked it
[5/28/25, 2:34:11 PM] Neil Tilston: I'm only 75% of the way through this but it's predictably ace. Have mogwai ever made a bad album? Must be one of the most consistent acts.
[5/28/25, 2:35:01 PM] Neil Tilston: Was really upset when I first saw this message as I thought it was about my tony hawks mix! 🤣
[5/28/25, 2:36:41 PM] Rory Edwards: I agree entirely with this. Iron Sky a huge tune and feels like the culmination of a deep build. Good record.
[5/28/25, 2:49:01 PM] Fergus Neville: Paulo not really for me either tbh. A poor man’s Gavin McGinty.

Shades one Michael Kiwanuka in the sound, not a bad thing. Don’t know if I’ll keep coming back to it, played it through a bunch in the office this week and think I got everything out of it, but will def look out for her stuff from now on

[5/30/25, 4:23:30 AM] Rory Edwards: I saw Felix Da Housecat in Aberdeen around then and it was totally banging.
[5/30/25, 4:24:33 AM] Rory Edwards: This is an extremely listenable record for me. It doesn't quite hit the heights as I don't think it has enough to say, but musically it's so on point. Soulful, funky, great vocal etc.
[5/30/25, 4:25:13 AM] Rory Edwards: This has good brooding bits and good airy reflective bits but felt it was missing something. The knowledge that it's a soundtrack might not have helped my listen.

[5/30/25, 3:07:51 PM] Neil Tilston: So I know I'm meant to idolise the Vaselines because 

A they're Scottish 
And
B kurt Cobain liked them

But I can't get that into them. They're not bad like. But they're not great right?
[5/30/25, 3:08:23 PM] David Thomas: Did we have an album fairly recently? I think that was my conclusion too
[5/30/25, 3:08:36 PM] Neil Tilston: Don't get me wrong mono is ace
[5/30/25, 3:08:52 PM] Neil Tilston: And the lad who used to be in the band seems really sound
[5/30/25, 3:09:01 PM] Neil Tilston: But if they weren't local we'd have no interest
[5/30/25, 3:11:50 PM] David Thomas: This is an interesting question- I think Scottish indie bands get played on the radio here a tonne, beta band and b&s definitely batting above average with an appeal to the outside world, but yeah not these guys.
[5/30/25, 3:22:22 PM] Rory Edwards: I don't think a famous musician liking them is a good reason to like a band particularly, maybe to try one, I just like the tune.
[5/30/25, 3:23:06 PM] Rory Edwards: Without the Cobain thing they might have been lost to history. There are plenty of bands with tunes worth listening to that have gone that way.
[5/31/25, 6:47:38 AM] Neil Tilston: Who's turn is it for a theme?

[6/3/25, 2:58:41 AM] Neil Tilston: Then realise I've had track one on repeat 🤦
[6/3/25, 1:01:59 PM] David Thomas: It’s fairly repetitive anyway to be fair, but I think it’s cool. the beats are much more upbeat than a typical Aesop rock album - I love his style - stand up camouflaged as rhymes - but find them a bit too dense to listen to full albums.
[6/3/25, 1:02:35 PM] David Thomas: The beats are guy called TOBACCO- @⁨Rory Edwards⁩ he did the soundtrack for the game ‘high on life’
[6/3/25, 1:52:26 PM] Fergus Neville: Very aware I’ve not picked anything yet - been away for a couple of days and unable to research “beats”. Will get on it.

[6/3/25, 1:54:51 PM] Fergus Neville: Marykirk near Edzell in Angus. Only about an hour’s drive but good to get away for the kids’ half term. Stunning beach recommended to us by Adam Ross!
[6/3/25, 1:57:02 PM] Neil Tilston: Lunan bay right? Lovely spot
[6/3/25, 1:57:49 PM] David Thomas: Beyond the flawless single, I’ve never been that excited by the orb before- actually got to the track that sounded like PBS and wanted to put pbs on instead - but stuck with it on in my office and ended up listening to it on repeat all day - think I finally get it. They generate this whole world that you have to let yourself be immersed in, and then occasionally drop a banger. Great pick
[6/3/25, 2:01:17 PM] Fergus Neville: No but that’s nearby and also lovely. This one is St Cyrus beach. Cliffs with seabirds (we saw peregrine falcons and fulmers), cracking beach and amazing caves. Definitely worth a visit.

[6/5/25, 3:12:54 PM] Neil Tilston: This album is nice. I love that track "The Look" remember it was one of my favourite tracks that year and I stuck it in tonnes of playlists . And now it's also on the AC playlist 🙂
[6/5/25, 3:14:29 PM] Neil Tilston: I agree with a lot of this. In truth I like the idea of Aesop rock. But in reality I never love him. This is probably my favourite release of his and I think it's largely due to Tobacco's ace production. At its best it sounds like El-P's bits on RTJ.
[6/5/25, 3:14:56 PM] Neil Tilston: This is epic and lovely.
5 stars
[6/5/25, 3:15:41 PM] Neil Tilston: Did anyone listen to this? I loved it. Think it's my favourite hip hop of the year so far. Absolutely wonderful boom bap beats with excellent varied rappers.
[6/5/25, 3:17:22 PM] Fergus Neville: Listened today and work and really liked it also! Didn’t know anything about it or even who picked it. 👍
[6/5/25, 3:17:52 PM] David Thomas: If I had to guess it was 100% Neil’s pick
[6/5/25, 3:18:44 PM] Neil Tilston: Tom caruna is known for making epic mash up albums. But he's an ace producer himself. On this album he actually played all the bass drums and keys himself and also used some samples to make the beats. Got tonnes of ace rappers to make the album.

[6/5/25, 3:22:10 PM] Rory Edwards: Really like this record too. A chilled out beach vibe like the perfect summer then it seems like something goes wrong and it gets progressively darker and harder access. Leads you in nicely.
[6/5/25, 3:23:30 PM] Rory Edwards: This is cool too. I really like Aesop Rock and the production on this is quite stripped back which lets his vocal shine. His rhymes aren't always on point but great flow.
[6/5/25, 3:32:38 PM] Neil Tilston: This is interesting. I think the opposite about Aesop. To me his writing is very clever but his flow is dull 🤷. It's clever to the point of being too clever and not fun? He's like the anti-biz markie 😅
[6/6/25, 2:55:58 AM] Neil Tilston: What's the plan for bangers?

[6/6/25, 12:21:54 PM] Fergus Neville: This was great, not least for the suprise reference to Deacon Blue's Ricky Ross
[6/6/25, 12:47:19 PM] Neil Tilston: Let’s make a playlist together, join and edit: Singles club

[6/6/25, 12:49:43 PM] Fergus Neville: Nice one. Does this also let us remove other people's picks we don't like?
[6/6/25, 12:49:49 PM] Neil Tilston: No idea
[6/6/25, 12:50:20 PM] David Thomas: Dancing in the dark going straight in the bin
[6/6/25, 1:40:06 PM] Neil Tilston: Are you giving us a single today?
[6/6/25, 5:22:56 PM] David Thomas: Aye sorry.

[6/6/25, 5:23:55 PM] David Thomas: Absolute shitter of a day involving both a radiation spill,  the entire network getting hacked, and I forgot my headphones
[6/6/25, 5:41:56 PM] Neil Tilston: Oh man hope you're ok
[6/6/25, 5:45:52 PM] David Thomas: Was rough on the train with only my thoughts to listen to, but I’ll be ok
[6/6/25, 5:46:29 PM] David Thomas: This is incredible, love the build up
[6/6/25, 9:15:16 PM] David Thomas: Saw fireflies in our back garden for the first time whilst drinking a Friday night beer, so alls well that ends well.xx
[6/7/25, 3:23:48 AM] Fergus Neville: I think it’s me for a theme? Pick an album which in some way references the coast/sea.
[6/7/25, 3:23:55 AM] Fergus Neville: https://open.spotify.com/album/7zrgHnkD5UDNoqoTN25upM?si=c-WGnAT7Ru-sgOTGPCHnQA
[6/7/25, 3:24:17 AM] Fergus Neville: (You’re welcome Dave)
[6/7/25, 6:32:46 AM] Neil Tilston: ?
[6/7/25, 6:48:28 AM] Rory Edwards: This was a hugely bugged question and I have been very disciplined in not asking. Glad someone else cracked 🤣
[6/7/25, 6:50:07 AM] Fergus Neville: I’m sure he says “Ricky Ross” at some point. I haven’t actually listened back though, and would rather not ruin it.
[6/7/25, 6:50:54 AM] Neil Tilston: Probably more likely rick ross no?
[6/7/25, 6:51:08 AM] Fergus Neville: Is that not still funny?
[6/7/25, 6:51:52 AM] Neil Tilston: Rick Ross the famous rapper from Miami

[6/7/25, 6:55:13 AM] Fergus Neville: The joke though was pretending it was the singer of a mildly popular pop rock band from Dundee
[6/7/25, 6:57:04 AM] Rory Edwards: Moving on. Dave is getting all the bonuses this week to make up for the radiation poisoning. Give this extremely @⁨David Thomas⁩ album a listen: Setting The Paces

[6/7/25, 9:03:44 AM] David Thomas: This looks superb, judging entirely by the cover art
[6/7/25, 9:04:54 AM] David Thomas: Should probably clarify that I wasn’t even in the building for the radiation spill, and it happens fairly frequently, it just involves extra paperwork that I didn’t want to do on Friday night
[6/7/25, 9:12:59 AM] Fergus Neville: First single is Spike Island
[6/7/25, 9:16:46 AM] Neil Tilston: Spike island is situated in the river Mersey not "the sea or coast" 🤓
[6/7/25, 9:17:26 AM] Neil Tilston: Dingies!
[6/7/25, 9:17:50 AM] Neil Tilston: 🧏
[6/7/25, 9:19:00 AM] Fergus Neville: Good point. I was just trying to pick a theme which would allow both KJ and Pulp. Sorry Dave, Neil says you have to choose something else.
[6/7/25, 9:21:01 AM] Neil Tilston: I think it's technically in the estuary of the river so you probably get away with it
[6/7/25, 9:21:19 AM] Neil Tilston: Just wanted to exemplify correct use of dingies tbh ‎<This message was edited>

[6/7/25, 9:36:26 AM] Neil Tilston: I was looking for something else in the playlist and realised there were two versions of little fluffy clouds on it
[6/7/25, 9:36:35 AM] Neil Tilston: Think they're about three years apart though
[6/7/25, 9:37:00 AM] David Thomas: 😱
[6/7/25, 9:37:23 AM] Neil Tilston: Can you guys help I'm trying to remember an album from a couple of years ago
[6/7/25, 9:37:30 AM] Neil Tilston: It was kinda of jazzy maths rock
[6/7/25, 9:37:37 AM] Neil Tilston: Think @⁨David Thomas⁩ picked it
[6/7/25, 9:37:51 AM] Neil Tilston: Maybe some yellow in the album cover?

[6/9/25, 4:13:52 PM] David Thomas: It’s a really really great cover
[6/9/25, 4:43:47 PM] Neil Tilston: I honestly think Andrew is the best working musician in the country right now. This was the album I began thinking that.

[6/9/25, 5:20:53 PM] Fergus Neville: Fantastic! Give us your dates!

[6/9/25, 5:57:57 PM] Fergus Neville: No fake news on the BBC
[6/11/25, 8:43:18 AM] David Thomas: Apologies if she’s already been discussed at length - what’s her story? It’s great, but found this a tough record to really ‘like’; bleak and heavy, dark and stormy, but really intriguing. Would make a terrific Halloween pick.
[6/11/25, 8:44:46 AM] David Thomas: Top marks for the all caps one words track titles
[6/11/25, 8:47:52 AM] Neil Tilston: Her work is all very dark and speaks to her traumatic experiences and those of other people she knows and loves. Her albums prior to this have been quite sparse and striking. This new collaboration with Lomond Campbell provides a more electronic and pulsing soundscape. This provides both a striking juxtaposition and another times respite from the heavy nature of the song subject matter.
[6/11/25, 8:48:16 AM] Neil Tilston: IMO LC's contribution makes her already impressive work even better.
[6/11/25, 8:48:56 AM] Neil Tilston: It's true what you say about how harrowing the songs are but I personally found that even more true of previous albums to the point I struggled to get through them. Whereas here I manage
[6/11/25, 12:45:23 PM] Fergus Neville: Sad to see that Brian Wilson has died
[6/11/25, 3:11:15 PM] David Thomas: This passed me by as ‘fine’ on the first few listens, currently stuck on a very slow train so listening again and paying attention to the lyrics. The instrumentals on it are gorgeous throughout, but Jarvis’ vocals tend to get lost in the mix a bit, which is a shame (a deliberate choice maybe?) cos the lyrics are some of his absolute best
‎[6/11/25, 3:11:30 PM] David Thomas: ‎image omitted
[6/11/25, 3:23:22 PM] David Thomas: Favorite lyrics so far either Tina - a love song to a girl he saw 14years ago but has never spoken to - “scenes from a marriage that never took place, although I did buy a ring once” or the disco/northern soul banger “got to have love” - “without love your just jerking off inside someone else”
[6/11/25, 3:25:46 PM] Rory Edwards: I really like it. Growing old disgracefully in a very self aware way.
[6/12/25, 2:24:16 AM] Neil Tilston: I'm still on first listen so happy to accept my similar "fine" impression likely to improve with more listens. Have spoken to a few folk who were at the gig in Glasgow at the weekend and by all accounts it was pretty special (although better gigs were available in fife that night)
[6/12/25, 8:27:21 AM] David Thomas: The pitchfork album review is predictably self-indulgent guff, but does call Jarvis the “laureate of genitalia” which is just great

[6/13/25, 11:58:17 AM] Neil Tilston: Two fun facts about Sam and Dave

- they HATED each other
- Isaac Hayes wrote most of their hits before he released his own music
[6/13/25, 12:00:08 PM] Fergus Neville: This makes me want to listen to Pet Sounds first instead
[6/13/25, 12:38:16 PM] Neil Tilston: Plenty of bands hated each other and made excellent music
[6/13/25, 12:38:22 PM] Neil Tilston: Including the beach boys!
[6/13/25, 12:38:57 PM] Neil Tilston: Brian Wilson and mike love's relationship was notoriously difficult
[6/13/25, 1:10:57 PM] Rory Edwards: I heard Big Rock Records had a big falling out. One bloke decided to jet off to foreign shores trying to make it big during the first Festival they organised.
[6/13/25, 1:11:24 PM] Rory Edwards: They took him back in but apparently only on the condition he wears orange forevermore so everyone can clearly see which one is the numpty
[6/13/25, 1:13:41 PM] Fergus Neville: * tangerine
[6/13/25, 1:14:41 PM] Rory Edwards: That was it. A very visible but otherwise totally stupid colour.
[6/13/25, 1:16:10 PM] Fergus Neville: Noel Gallagher on The Beach Boys: "Don’t you think they’re the most overrated group of all time? The only reason that they are anyway successful is because they are next to The Beatles in alphabetical order and Paul McCartney likes them. That’s it. Barbershop quartet music. Fucking rubbish.”
[6/13/25, 5:26:51 PM] Neil Tilston: Btw Spotify has done that thing again...

[6/16/25, 11:31:54 AM] David Thomas: This is batshit borderline unlistenable - do I need to listen again to uncovers its true genius?
[6/16/25, 11:32:31 AM] Fergus Neville: There's maybe a reason it remained unreleased for 40 years
[6/16/25, 11:33:01 AM] Fergus Neville: It sounded fine as background music, but I've yet to give it a headphones listen
[6/16/25, 11:34:11 AM] David Thomas: Heroes and villains is cool, and good vibrations
[6/16/25, 11:34:17 AM] Neil Tilston: It's like the opposite of let it be naked. He's taken a classic beach boys record and rerecorded it to deliberately make it more bloated.  It thought it was fine but not amazing. Which tbh is same for pet sounds. It's good music but it doesn't excite me
[6/16/25, 11:34:42 AM] Neil Tilston: Feel a bit dirty to agree with Noel Gallagher though
[6/17/25, 12:01:00 PM] Rory Edwards: It's like someone asked Musk's rubbish AI to rewrite a Beach Boys album but 'make it much cooler, like what the kids these days are listening to'
[6/17/25, 12:02:37 PM] David Thomas: “Wilson argued that the mid-1960s wasn’t the right time to release it, explaining, “We think people are now ready to understand where it was coming from. Back then, no one was ready for it."

[6/17/25, 12:18:36 PM] Rory Edwards: Word 'quite' working hard there. I suppose it did land decades after.
[6/17/25, 12:22:15 PM] Neil Tilston: Pet sounds was before sgt pepepr
[6/17/25, 12:27:48 PM] Rory Edwards: Smile seems to have been in development at a similar time then.

[6/17/25, 12:42:57 PM] David Thomas: Yeah, all the bits i thought were worth the effort are on smiley smile already
[6/17/25, 12:46:01 PM] Neil Tilston: To be fair to him smile on its own is a better title than smiley smile
[6/17/25, 12:46:26 PM] Neil Tilston: Smiley smile sounds like an awful 80s game show hosted by Bruce Forsyth or cilla black ‎<This message was edited>

[6/18/25, 5:49:26 PM] Fergus Neville: Uncle Vic was right - OSSES definitely one of the best live acts on the planet. More bands with two drummers please!
[6/18/25, 5:56:13 PM] Neil Tilston: Thom Yorke killed my favourite two drummer band
[6/18/25, 6:01:13 PM] David Thomas: Slipknot?
[6/18/25, 6:01:23 PM] Neil Tilston: Sons of kemet
[6/18/25, 6:01:38 PM] Neil Tilston: He pinched one of the drummers for his side project
[6/18/25, 6:02:20 PM] Neil Tilston: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Skinner_(drummer)
[6/18/25, 6:03:27 PM] David Thomas: I didn’t really think it was slipknot
[6/18/25, 6:04:06 PM] David Thomas: Saw a band in Edinburgh with Bob one time that had two drummers, some sort of post rock/ electronic stuff - any ideas who I’m talking about?
[6/18/25, 6:08:05 PM] Neil Tilston: Swans?
[6/18/25, 6:08:35 PM] David Thomas: No
[6/18/25, 6:11:02 PM] Neil Tilston: I went to a gig with Bob once where Keiran hebdon (four yet) was doing electronic stuff with a pretty amazing jazz drummer. Pretty sure there was only one drummer though

[6/20/25, 8:23:51 AM] David Thomas: Are we adding these to the playlist ourselves these days?
[6/20/25, 8:26:32 AM] Neil Tilston: Fergus made me change the settings so he could. But then didn't bother so I added anyway 😂
[6/20/25, 8:26:38 AM] Neil Tilston: I always add when I listen
[6/20/25, 8:26:53 AM] Neil Tilston: If I ever get a message saying it's already been done then I'll know what's happened

[6/20/25, 9:14:44 AM] Fergus Neville: You'd missed some tracks, and when I pointed this out you complained that we didn't understand how collaborative playlists work so I suggested you change the settings to at least give us the option
[6/20/25, 9:15:16 AM] Fergus Neville: As you say it's probably best just for the first person who is available/can be bothered to add
[6/20/25, 9:15:34 AM] Fergus Neville: I know you don't listen to it much Neil, but I quite often stick it on random!
[6/20/25, 9:15:55 AM] Fergus Neville: This week I could only ever pick a live OSEES track 🔥🔥🔥

[6/20/25, 11:51:02 AM] Neil Tilston: Quite often when artists nowadays release multiple pre album singles they do it one at a time and the previously released singles appear in a "album/ep/single" like this on streaming.
[6/20/25, 11:52:15 AM] Neil Tilston: I expect that "take a sexy picture of me" is a single in its own right and has been out for longer than "The Jamie Oliver petrol station" which is just out so hasn't had time to accumulate as many streams

[6/20/25, 3:02:02 PM] Rory Edwards: This was all news to me.
[6/21/25, 4:38:31 AM] Neil Tilston: Who's next for a theme?
[6/21/25, 4:48:11 AM] Rory Edwards: Think it may be me. A few bands been enjoying impressive renaissances recently. People raving about Pulp and NiN's tours while I've been enjoying  Doves' latest.
[6/21/25, 4:48:52 AM] Rory Edwards: Sometimes feel newer albums from great bands fall flat purely because they lack novelty, or conversely try to be novel and fall flat because they weren't the same.
[6/21/25, 4:49:25 AM] Rory Edwards: Anyway pick a later album by someone who has been around for a bit.
[6/21/25, 4:49:52 AM] Rory Edwards: Give this album a listen: Crooked Wing

[6/23/25, 12:08:07 PM] Neil Tilston: Is @⁨Fergus Neville⁩ still picking an album most weeks?
[6/23/25, 12:35:23 PM] Fergus Neville: Sorry, just listening through various options, all of which were annoyingly good which has made the choice harder. I'll plump for this one though, as the others are records someone will end up picking anyway.

[6/23/25, 12:36:38 PM] Fergus Neville: WITCH were massive in Zambia in the 1970s playing freaky psychadelic rock. They've reformed relatively recently, and their new record is a banger. ‎<This message was edited>
[6/23/25, 12:36:58 PM] Fergus Neville: I'm mostly picking them because WITCH stands for "We Intend To Cause Havoc"

[6/24/25, 9:30:47 AM] David Thomas: Looking like the 18-25 July!
[6/24/25, 11:09:47 AM] Fergus Neville: I'm away on holiday down south from the 19th-25th! Where will you be on the 18th? Why are you dingying Lughnasadh?!
[6/24/25, 11:12:45 AM] David Thomas: Kids will be with lorna's parents for a couple of weeks, so my job is to pick them up. I have my annual conference in DC last week of July so need to be back for that unfortunately
[6/24/25, 11:12:59 AM] David Thomas: When's lugnasendy?

[6/24/25, 11:30:08 AM] David Thomas: There's a slim chance I can do some fernagaling to get  that to work, but will need a good reason why the grandparents will have the kids for another week
[6/24/25, 11:30:45 AM] David Thomas: Are you's bringing kids?
[6/24/25, 11:30:58 AM] Fergus Neville: Definitely - very family friendly
[6/24/25, 11:37:18 AM] Rory Edwards: Our two and Moore's two will be there.
[6/24/25, 11:40:49 AM] David Thomas: That's been shot down pretty quickly unfortunately
[6/24/25, 11:41:09 AM] Fergus Neville: Boo!
[6/24/25, 12:02:44 PM] David Thomas: @⁨Fergus Neville⁩ do you need a house sitter for when you're away?
[6/24/25, 12:20:12 PM] Neil Tilston: Ah mate. I'll be in Ireland
[6/24/25, 12:25:14 PM] David Thomas: noo!
[6/24/25, 2:57:14 PM] Fergus Neville: Ordinarily would have loved that (even more so if we were actually here!) but we’re taking advantage of being away to get the plumber and painter in (and hopefully the stonemason although they’re now muttering about possible delays). Sorry!
[6/24/25, 2:57:50 PM] David Thomas: oh nice, fair enoihh
[6/24/25, 2:58:45 PM] David Thomas: Currently have a massive skip and piles of roof 'shingles' outside our house, but no roofers cos it's 'too hot' (which is totally fair enough, it’s roasting)
[6/24/25, 3:03:35 PM] Fergus Neville: Won’t be nice, it’ll be expensive and a faff but thanks!
[6/24/25, 3:04:14 PM] Fergus Neville: Got rid of the asbestos yet? Our community centre apparently has the “bad asbestos”. Is that an accurate physics term?
[6/24/25, 3:05:42 PM] Rory Edwards: We're here @⁨David Thomas⁩. We have a spare room if you're needing a place to be at any point.
[6/24/25, 4:40:59 PM] Fergus Neville: Superb records this week pals! My one is the weakest, but still fun hopefully.
[6/27/25, 4:19:07 AM] Rory Edwards: A good week of listening for  me.
[6/27/25, 4:20:11 AM] Rory Edwards: I liked this. Really interesting combo of styles..Particularly enjoyed it's sung gospel.moments.
[6/27/25, 4:20:46 AM] Rory Edwards: The Hold Steady make a Counting Crows record about dealing with you shit. It's good.
[6/27/25, 4:21:46 AM] Rory Edwards: Full of interesting ideas and well deserves a go around. Occasionally falls flat but when it's good it soars. Though Immortal Hands was an incredible track.
[6/27/25, 4:23:44 AM] Rory Edwards: What did folk think of my ethereal choral folk music that occasionally had an industrial metal moment. Like appreciating the beauty of nature on a brooding walk on a wet day.
[6/27/25, 4:24:04 AM] Rory Edwards: Or that bit where the choir kicks in just before you hit phase 2 of the boss fight.

[6/27/25, 6:59:09 AM] David Thomas: Would love to know the thought processes that went into this pick??
[6/27/25, 7:00:18 AM] Fergus Neville: A band which has been around forever who have a new album (which I almost picked this week). It's an attack on consumerism and poseurs, makes me laugh and gets stuck in my head. A banger in an unconventional sense. Also, Sparks rule.
[6/27/25, 7:02:22 AM] Fergus Neville: Neil and I's friend Ailsa went to see them in Manchester last week. She's a slightly akward (but lovely!) character herself, and when she chanced about Ron Mael from the band in the street it made for a predictably weird and hilarious photo.

I've been pondering which Low album to pick all day, and then Kathryn Joseph just mentioned how much she loves Secret Name on Radio Scotland and I've never heard of it! So here we go...

[7/3/25, 6:19:34 AM] Rory Edwards: Can't believe folk are angry about the Funky Gunners tour. Thought the "Death to the SQA' chants maybe a bit strong but it's official Government policy now.
[7/3/25, 8:55:47 AM] Fergus Neville: This is incredible. It is long, but I love it on first listen. Great contrast to the first BSP record you chose (which is also good but obviously in very different ways).
[7/3/25, 12:56:27 PM] Rory Edwards: So glad you liked it. Our first video game soundtrack surely? It was a long game but extremely deep game both emotionally and morally. The soundtrack hugely added to the atmosphere.

[7/4/25, 4:01:23 AM] Fergus Neville: Apologies for how late it is and the lack of booze - there was quite an ordeal trying to order you wine, beer, whisky or anything above 0%, but US customs weren’t having it. Rebecca tried to do it on our behalf, but we couldn’t even get it to work out of state 🤷‍♂️

[7/5/25, 4:38:01 PM] David Thomas: “Hello six pack of confidence” is something I’ve said to myself every time I’ve bought a pack of beer for the last 10years, but didn’t know where it was from until I heard this again
[7/5/25, 4:55:47 PM] Fergus Neville: I remember going to see Less Than Jake in Atlanta with you Dave. It was the day I arrived and I think we went straight from the airport. What was that weird goth venue called again? I’m pretty sure it had monster coming out of a coffin nailed up to a wall by the stage. A great night!

I was worried when I heard that little Simz had fallen out with inflo. But her first record without him in years is ace
[7/5/25, 5:02:03 PM] David Thomas: nice, didn’t know this was out already
[7/6/25, 1:33:56 PM] Rory Edwards: Haven't listened but her set at Glastonbury was absolutely banging. Jazz big band stuff. https://open.spotify.com/album/3U8n8LzBx2o9gYXvvNq4uH?si=-Z5k1kqVQ2e-61Lj2ZgrLg%0A

[7/6/25, 5:32:42 PM] Fergus Neville: Currently listening to this with my Dad while sampling the local Cairngorms ales as he regales me of when he saw one of the band’s 1975 Earls Court gigs which were meant to be their best
[7/7/25, 6:49:00 AM] David Thomas: This is gorgeous, so so good
[7/7/25, 6:59:25 PM] David Thomas: Really enjoyed both British Sea Power albums this week - indie throw back was a fun listen, but the disco Elysium album is really really good, keeps on giving. Suspect it’ll be my go to at work for a few days yet. Didn’t have the patience for the game, but maybe I’ll give it another go (I won’t).
[7/7/25, 7:04:33 PM] David Thomas: Someone should pick a video game soundtrack theme, cos I’m currently playing through SackBoy with the kids and it has an absolutely banger soundtrack

[7/7/25, 7:07:22 PM] David Thomas: This was fucking awful
[7/7/25, 7:09:52 PM] David Thomas: Liked trampled by turtles a lot, very pretty and varied enough to keep me interested, don't think I knew this was what TbT sounded like, but wouldn’t be mad if you picked some more by then
[7/7/25, 7:11:00 PM] David Thomas: I really tried again with Low, but a holiday week wasn’t the time nor the place (Jersey Shore). I know that they have a tragic story, but I just don’t get anything out of any of their songs, sorry 😢
[7/7/25, 7:12:05 PM] David Thomas: St Vincent is great - can’t remember which one i listened to so will go back and listen to em both again
[7/7/25, 7:12:39 PM] David Thomas: Two albums each is too many - how did we used to do this every week?
[7/7/25, 7:15:34 PM] David Thomas: This is mostly shite, but when it’s good it’s great - “best wishes to your black lung” (what?)
[7/8/25, 7:28:02 AM] Neil Tilston: Not enough trumpet. This is the album where less than Jake tried to emulate blink 182.

This is my favourite because it at least sounds like them
[7/8/25, 8:04:26 AM] David Thomas: This sounds exactly like them?
[7/8/25, 8:04:40 AM] David Thomas: Ah, sorry - misread your message!!
[7/8/25, 8:04:55 AM] David Thomas: Thought you said “sounds least like them”!
[7/8/25, 8:05:37 AM] Neil Tilston: No it's a total highlight. Would have preferred an album in that mould
[7/8/25, 11:20:15 AM] Neil Tilston: Her best album since grey area imo. The different collaborators all being something different to the table and the sounds fluctuate from jazz to bass to Reggae to post punk but simbi holds it all together. Likely to make my top albums of the year list .
[7/8/25, 11:21:28 AM] Neil Tilston: Was a bit worried I wasn't going to like this after a few poppy and autotune heavy tracks at the start. I've seen her live on the telly a few times and been impressed but this was my first time with a full album. She won me over with her clear star quality, excellent voice and killer tunes
[7/8/25, 11:23:10 AM] Neil Tilston: I've always found this album a bit of a slog tbh. I'm halfway through and taking a break. Maybe the second half is better than I remember? ‎<This message was edited>
[7/8/25, 11:24:32 AM] David Thomas: I gave up half way through too! Thought I was just being a lightweight
[7/8/25, 11:25:36 AM] Neil Tilston: I know Fergus will be horrified but I've never been as big a Led Zep fan as some others. I do quite like the first four records and a lot of plant's post Zep work

[7/11/25, 5:37:05 AM] David Thomas: Guessing it’s free choice bangers today?

[7/11/25, 6:46:23 AM] David Thomas: A sweet philly’s bottle opener just arrived to go with this - assuming it was from you sweathearts. 🥰😘😍

[7/11/25, 6:56:43 AM] David Thomas: Disappointing lack of love for bloodshot bill. Raw, slightly unhinged, one man band, sounds like it’s recorded straight to tape, no production here whatsoever, gravelly ‘Cramps’-esk raunchy pyscobilly. I loved it, and I bet he has a kick ass Halloween album
[7/11/25, 8:10:05 AM] Fergus Neville: I only got to these yesterday, but loved them too for the reasons you say! Meant to message, sorry.
[7/11/25, 10:25:43 AM] Rory Edwards: That sounds totally ace. Love Portugal.
[7/11/25, 10:26:13 AM] Rory Edwards: Finally back on a temporary phone (for 24 hours before it takes two days for them to send me a new, new one etc).

[7/12/25, 1:58:31 PM] David Thomas: This is gorgeous
[7/15/25, 8:40:49 PM] David Thomas: Think this is exceptional, exceeded my expectations. Really varied, and nearly all absolute bangers. The best version of this since mylo’s album
[7/15/25, 8:41:19 PM] David Thomas: Maybe could do with less of the spoken word
[7/16/25, 4:37:14 AM] Fergus Neville: This is definitely hitting the spot in the office this morning!

[7/18/25, 6:41:55 AM] Neil Tilston: A great listen perfect festival friendly dance music for sunny days ☀️
[7/18/25, 6:42:18 AM] Neil Tilston: I enjoyed this as well. Lovely easy summery jazz from kokoroko ♥️
[7/18/25, 6:43:13 AM] Neil Tilston: A masterpiece. Usually non lyrical vocalisations on jazz records annoy the fuck out of me but here they make for a really cool cinematic vibe 👌

[7/24/25, 4:16:33 AM] Neil Tilston: Nothing I don't think you'd already know. Lots of buzz around Jacob Alon. Id try and catch Anthony Szmierek, Kathryn Joseph, Ibibio sound machine, the scratch, sprints and benefits
[7/24/25, 4:17:26 AM] Fergus Neville: They’re all on my list (except Sprints who have pulled out) except for Jacob Alon who I’ve not heard. Will check him out, ta!
[7/24/25, 4:21:07 AM] Neil Tilston: Got a lot of coverage in the skinny this year also mark (from Assai and Theo Bleak) was raving about them to me. I gave it a spin and was a a little underwhelmed but I seem to be in the minority so would probably check it out love to see if it makes more sense that way

[7/25/25, 3:08:36 AM] Fergus Neville: I’ve listened to almost nothing as it’s hard being away, plus we’re spending all our listening time researching Deer Shed. What I’ve heard of my pick it was pretty unlistenable though! Will get to them all next week.
[7/25/25, 3:08:50 AM] Fergus Neville: Let me make up for it with a monster banger

[7/25/25, 4:08:32 AM] David Thomas: Don’t know what that means but yes 🙌
[7/25/25, 12:31:20 PM] Neil Tilston: I wasn't as keen on this week's records tbh
[7/25/25, 12:32:22 PM] Neil Tilston: This was good for about twenty minutes or so but didn't have enough variation to keep me interested. A good few tracks that are great for a party playlist or a Friday banger but as a whole album I wouldn't return to it.
[7/25/25, 12:34:06 PM] Neil Tilston: I like Connor a lot although always surprised how indie this sounds compared to the live show. As a live act it's pure rock and roll energy combining the energies of Slade/acdc/ the darkness etc. on the album it definitely has a bit more of the view style sound. Some great tracks on it though. Looking forward to kicking off Lughnasadh next week with lo FI love, glorious glamorous etc
[7/25/25, 12:35:08 PM] Neil Tilston: This is vary difficult to get into. It's certainly different from much else I've heard before. I honestly don't know if it's great and I just didn't get into it or if it's not for me. I'm not in a rush to try again but maybe I'll come to love it...
[7/25/25, 12:36:19 PM] Neil Tilston: This was quite cool in a more understated way than I expected. Shades of the streets and even early Kanye with the soulful production. Street tales but with a bit of personal vulnerability. I'm not sure if I'd keep going back to it. But it's nice enough
[7/25/25, 4:46:11 PM] Fergus Neville: Finlay on my shoulders for the whole of Anthony Smierneck. May not survive the night. EPIC though!

[7/27/25, 4:44:35 AM] Fergus Neville: Deer Shed excellent so far. Highlights so far include Anthony Smierick, Kathryn Joseph, Tommy Wa, Unthanks, Adult DVD, Ibibio Sound Machine, Kae Tempest and Hamish Hawk.

[7/29/25, 5:30:24 AM] Neil Tilston: Not hundreds no. I was cutting the grass and must have disturbed without realising. Got stung on my legs about 8 times. ‎<This message was edited>
[7/29/25, 6:22:34 AM] David Thomas: Ouch - they’re so painful, 8 different stings must be really bad - yeah get some anti histamines
[7/29/25, 6:23:12 AM] David Thomas: While your recovering you should go back and re listen to that excellent Kesha album, which you clearly gave up on before it got good again at the end
[7/29/25, 6:26:18 AM] David Thomas: Agree it starts out too good, and gets a bit bland after track 3, but then boy crazy, glow and too hard and trash man are all top notch pop tracks to end with. Easily five five-star tracks - which maybe doesn’t make a 5 star album, but it’s not far off
[7/30/25, 3:54:54 AM] Neil Tilston: Sorry man it's just not for me. Any of those songs are grand on their own or on a party playlist but as an album I can't get into it. Sorry
[7/30/25, 3:55:46 AM] Neil Tilston: This on the other hand is rather raw organic and beautiful. Few bands manage to call to mind the ethos and sounds of Low but this sounds like what made Low great imo ♥️
[7/30/25, 3:56:23 AM] Neil Tilston: I'm not in pain anymore which is nice.

But

HOLY FUCK IT'S ITCHY!
[7/30/25, 6:08:27 AM] David Thomas: 100 days to Halloween boys
[7/30/25, 12:42:45 PM] Rory Edwards: Rubbish mate. I hate those sodding things. Were you drowsy at all? Eight stings is a lot
[7/30/25, 12:44:21 PM] Rory Edwards: Couldn't agree more, beautiful records  I think it almost sounds improvised in places, like being at a campfire where someone brought a trombone.
[7/30/25, 12:47:30 PM] Rory Edwards: Or like Phil Elverum made an album that wasn't about death.
[7/30/25, 12:53:42 PM] Rory Edwards: If we have a melancholy pick this week it's this one. It's brilliant though, a stirring, introspective emotional journey.
[7/30/25, 12:58:06 PM] David Thomas: currently completely obsessed with it - been wandering around the Washington DC convention center hungover the last two days with it on my headphones. I'm not completely convinced that it works as an album - not really sure what tilda adds to it - but the music is mesmerizing
[7/30/25, 1:09:20 PM] Neil Tilston: Agree with all
[7/30/25, 1:09:39 PM] Neil Tilston: Wasn't drowsy just demented!
[7/30/25, 1:13:47 PM] Rory Edwards: More demented 😛
[7/30/25, 1:13:58 PM] Rory Edwards: I only ask because whenever I get stung by a wasp I need a wee sleep. Doesn't seem to happen with bees #itisamystery.
[7/30/25, 1:16:32 PM] David Thomas: Sleepiness is a histamine release - get straight on the benadryl
[7/30/25, 1:17:01 PM] David Thomas: Not sure there's anything for dementedness tho
[7/30/25, 1:17:39 PM] Neil Tilston: Tennants lager?

[8/1/25, 2:36:08 PM] Rory Edwards: I enjoyed this, will be interesting to see what he does next. Think the key will be making the most of that unusual vocal.
[8/1/25, 2:38:35 PM] Rory Edwards: I like this a lot, combined some of the best bits of the slightly shouty, tongue in cheek, punk that's been around recently. Thought it was going to be all the same for a bit then it got deeper as it went. Last track really good.
[8/4/25, 5:15:36 AM] Neil Tilston: Have we got a new theme?

[8/5/25, 11:25:58 AM] Fergus Neville: Shelly was one of the best tracks played on Saturday. Belter of a tune!
[8/5/25, 12:09:42 PM] Fergus Neville: I enjoyed Tommy Wa on my own snoozing in the early afternoon sun at Deer Shed. He's a Nigerian currently living in Ghana I think. His music won't change the world, but I liked his voice and the songs are charming and appropriately summery.

He has a new EP coming out soon, but here's his effort from 2023.

[8/13/25, 3:19:55 AM] Rory Edwards: Brilliant fun from these guys and a classic guitar sound. Feels like the spiritual successor to Definitely Maybe in some places.and Queen in others. Can see their influence everywhere despite them never seeming to take themselves too seriously.

[8/13/25, 11:00:34 AM] David Thomas: Dogs for the deaf excellent name
[8/13/25, 11:00:54 AM] Fergus Neville: Maybe QOTSA could speak to Run The Jewels? 😺
[8/13/25, 7:28:04 PM] David Thomas: This is the ‘big’ AC/DC album I know the least, and yeah was surprised how clean and melodic it sounds, @⁨Rory Edwards⁩ nailed it with the definitely maybe lineage. Less of the faux-sleezyness dirty cludgy sounds of ‘dirty deeds’, more bluesy goodness.
[8/13/25, 7:29:15 PM] David Thomas: 5stars. I think I fell out with AC/DC after someone here picked there latest release, and pointed out how creepy it was - this is fresh and sounds brand new
[8/13/25, 7:30:35 PM] David Thomas: Album artwork gotta be up there with one of the best of all time, especially given it was their debut album
[8/14/25, 2:57:30 PM] Neil Tilston: apologies for the WhatsApp spam all. If you can spare a like/share/"interested in the event" on Facebook for this id be super grateful as it might just make the algorithm get the word out before Grant and I play at this (rather big if awesome) venue tomorrow 🙏

[8/15/25, 6:17:21 AM] David Thomas: Beers with uncle Steven?
[8/15/25, 8:38:47 AM] Neil Tilston: Glad this went down well. I think it's one of their best. Perhaps a little underrated compared with back in black and highway to hell?
[8/15/25, 8:39:19 AM] Neil Tilston: This was pretty fun for a few tracks at least
[8/15/25, 8:39:50 AM] Rory Edwards: I thought this was a joyful little riot. Also for a bit.
[8/15/25, 8:40:00 AM] Neil Tilston: This was lengthy and is why I've not got to QOTSA yet. I liked it though and enjoyed how much they incorporated old school rock n roll to their hard rock sound
[8/15/25, 8:40:06 AM] Fergus Neville: I really enjoyed it too. I knew the big tunes, but don't think I'd listened to the album through. Agree with Dave it has the best parts of the classic rock/blues sound without (as much) sleeze.

[8/15/25, 10:53:56 AM] Fergus Neville: I've picked a Junior Dell & the D-Lites tune before, but it was a while ago and they're so good
[8/15/25, 10:54:01 AM] Neil Tilston: Also in the bag for tonight!
[8/15/25, 10:54:15 AM] Fergus Neville: Plus The Big Moon covered Praise You in their headline set at Deer Shed and it was a real highlight
[8/15/25, 12:12:40 PM] Neil Tilston: Any of disc 2 worth attention?

[8/16/25, 4:42:34 AM] Neil Tilston: I played the junior dell track as well but that was quite early
[8/16/25, 4:43:11 AM] Rory Edwards: A classic
[8/16/25, 4:43:22 AM] Rory Edwards: How did it go mate?
[8/16/25, 4:43:40 AM] Neil Tilston: It was good fun but a bit quiet - it's a huge space!
[8/16/25, 4:43:54 AM] Neil Tilston: Big love to @⁨Fergus Neville⁩ for coming along
[8/16/25, 4:48:05 AM] Rory Edwards: Keep booking them. They will come.

[8/16/25, 8:20:47 AM] Rory Edwards: Not sure, missing a month of the chat too so can't even check 🤣
[8/16/25, 8:21:07 AM] Rory Edwards: Me or @⁨Fergus Neville⁩? I have an idea.
[8/16/25, 8:21:24 AM] David Thomas: Pretty sure it's you
[8/16/25, 8:22:31 AM] Rory Edwards: By the way I think this album is the best way to do Deep Purple. They bring loads of skill and energy to this show but only really the skill to their records imo. Also a classic case of a band murdered by its biggest song.
[8/16/25, 8:23:38 AM] Rory Edwards: This is amazing when it's good but a bit patchy. 4/5 -
[8/16/25, 8:24:36 AM] Rory Edwards: That transition between the first two tunes is out of this world. I am.likong the second disk so may report back.
[8/16/25, 8:24:48 AM] Neil Tilston: In rock is a pretty great studio album imo
[8/16/25, 8:25:22 AM] Neil Tilston: Hard to think of a record with a more impactful opening two tracks
[8/16/25, 8:25:52 AM] Rory Edwards: For this week's theme pick something with some spoken word on it. I don't really care how loosely you interpret that. A wee spoken intro is fine if you're struggling.
[8/16/25, 8:25:56 AM] Rory Edwards: I am not struggling.

[8/16/25, 8:27:19 AM] Fergus Neville: I read an interview with Joshua Homme where he said he intentionally writes weaker tracks to make the bangers stand out. Seems dubious to me!
[8/16/25, 8:28:08 AM] Neil Tilston: Lol
[8/16/25, 8:28:45 AM] Neil Tilston: Sweet I've been meaning to listen to this. I adored the first album and the single I heard earlier this year was ace

[8/18/25, 2:09:38 PM] David Thomas: King Gizzard gone too :-(
[8/18/25, 2:10:26 PM] Rory Edwards: Been meaning to get Godspeed on vinyl for a while so...
[8/18/25, 3:22:06 PM] Neil Tilston: Wow. Only first listen but this is incredible. Even better than the last album. Id compare it to Fontaine's DC meets Arab Strap but tbh it's wowed me more than either of those ever have. Almost definitely probably album of the year
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
[8/18/25, 3:25:21 PM] Rory Edwards: It's brilliant. Like it's not always a cheery listen but there is hope there. Pride too in the midst of hardship. The beats are sensational. I can't think of another album that could pull off finishing with amazing grace on the bagpipes with a straight face.
[8/18/25, 3:30:34 PM] Neil Tilston: There's an incredible authenticity and intelligence to his voice. Obviously I don't live in Ireland but I spend a lot of time there and talk to family and so much rings true. The musical beds are rich and emotive and perfectly match the and compliment the topics .
[8/18/25, 6:55:01 PM] David Thomas: A slightly less enthusiastic review from me after a first listen on a gloomy sleepy Monday morning early in work- just wasn’t in the right head space for it. I didn’t want to be at work, and he didn’t want to be in Ireland, and the beats didn’t immediately grab me.  But given your rave reviews, will absolutely stick it on again with a whiskey of an evening and listen out for the amazing bagpipes of grace.
[8/19/25, 2:19:03 AM] Rory Edwards: He does want to be in Ireland, despite it all. He's  just not 100% sure why 🤣
[8/19/25, 4:07:16 AM] Fergus Neville: Sorry, been away without signal. Have thought of 4 good choices for this, all of which I’ve looked up and we’ve had before 🤦‍♂️

[8/19/25, 1:24:38 PM] Neil Tilston: Hi guys I'm afraid I got some bad news at the hospital today. The consultant has said I have "suspected testicular cancer" based on the lump on my right side. I'll be getting surgery in the next 2-3 weeks which will then have a 2-3 week recovery period after that I'll have a consultation where the possibility of further treatment beyond will be discussed (although it's likely and hopefully that the surgery alone will be enough).
[8/19/25, 1:27:17 PM] David Thomas: Sorry to hear that Neil, but very  likely a nice clean snip will take care of it for good.
[8/19/25, 1:27:35 PM] David Thomas: Glad your getting in quickly
[8/19/25, 1:28:28 PM] Neil Tilston: Thanks man yep that's all true it seems likely we've got it early and hopefully that's all it'll take 👍
[8/19/25, 5:47:43 PM] David Thomas: This is also really great
[8/19/25, 5:48:36 PM] David Thomas: This weeks sub-theme seems to be folks who hate the places they live, or at least love to hate them.
[8/20/25, 7:17:31 AM] Rory Edwards: This is impactful but insane bleak. Couple of bangers on it though, particularly like more hip hop moments. The second tune and Blame my favourites.
[8/20/25, 7:18:29 AM] David Thomas: Same - it’s all over the place, from superb when it’s good to a bit cringy. Wish I’d seen them live in a tent @⁨Fergus Neville⁩ !
[8/20/25, 7:19:03 AM] David Thomas: What does ‘desert island dickheads’ mean? It’s stuck in my head
[8/20/25, 7:21:58 AM] Fergus Neville: Agree with all of that - it was a blast live, but still has some good moments on records. They had Shakk on stage with them for lots of songs (he's on Divide on the album) which really helped with the energy
[8/20/25, 7:22:01 AM] Fergus Neville: https://www.stereofox.com/artists/shakk/#
[8/20/25, 7:23:04 AM] Fergus Neville: The "worthy" people who are interviewed for it I think? There seems to be a theme about middle-class passivity and ignorance set against domestic/overseas suffering. Could equally apply to Radio 4 listeners I suppose.
[8/20/25, 7:23:59 AM] Fergus Neville: I had a wee chat with Kingsley who is the front man as I bumped into him in the crowd later in the day. He was lovely and thankfully not as angry as he was on stage!
[8/20/25, 7:24:52 AM] Fergus Neville: "Last of the summer whining" is also a good line

[8/20/25, 8:17:47 AM] Fergus Neville: Oh wow, that would be good
[8/20/25, 2:07:25 PM] Neil Tilston: A wee update. My op will be on Tuesday in Perth after that I'll need 2-3 weeks recovery time and around that time I'll find out if that's it or I need any further treatment. Thanks for all your support x
[8/20/25, 2:12:36 PM] Rory Edwards: Oh wow that's happening really soon in the end.
[8/20/25, 2:19:21 PM] Rory Edwards: I'm apprehensive for you. Hope you're holding up ok.
[8/20/25, 2:46:56 PM] Neil Tilston: I'm glad it's soon
[8/21/25, 11:57:43 AM] Fergus Neville: Was about to put on another gloomy spoken word album then realised I hadn't listened to the live Deep Purple record from last week. Result!
[8/21/25, 12:00:03 PM] David Thomas: Haha. Passive aggressive pan
[8/21/25, 12:36:11 PM] Fergus Neville: I’ve been enjoying the bleak hellscape mutterings, but was more in the mood for mindless riffs and indulgent drum solos

[8/22/25, 6:59:28 AM] David Thomas: It’s definitely not

[8/22/25, 7:02:14 AM] Rory Edwards: Guys AI is disrupting the lucrative finding shite music to post on album club market. We should all be very grateful to our internet regurgitating robot overlords.
[8/22/25, 7:02:43 AM] Rory Edwards: Some would say this was a solved problem but music can always be shiter imo.
[8/22/25, 7:03:06 AM] Fergus Neville: The one I posted might not be the original, but I doubt it's AI if it was produced in 2008
[8/22/25, 7:03:19 AM] Rory Edwards: Classic original though, can't say I can think of many other hits by movie directors.
[8/22/25, 7:03:35 AM] Rory Edwards: My only surprise of the week so far - no PSB.

[8/22/25, 7:26:03 AM] David Thomas: The Ed Sheeran of house music actually made a whole spoken word album about ferg posting ai slop on album club
[8/22/25, 7:31:54 AM] Fergus Neville: 🎶 Album Title: "Loop Theory"

Genre: House / Deep House / Vocal House
Artist: Ed Sheeran
Release Date: Imaginary – let's say August 2025
🌌 Concept & Vibe

"Loop Theory" is Ed Sheeran’s bold venture into the world of house music, blending his signature acoustic storytelling with hypnotic beats, soulful drops, and deep grooves. The album explores themes of connection, rhythm, and emotional resonance through the lens of electronic soundscapes.
[8/22/25, 7:32:04 AM] Fergus Neville: 🧩 Tracklist

    Pulse & Poetry
    A warm, melodic opener with Sheeran’s vocals layered over a chilled house groove. Lyrics explore the rhythm of relationships.

    Neon Heartbeat
    A club-ready anthem with a driving bassline and shimmering synths. Think Ibiza sunset meets London soul.

    Echoes of You
    Deep house with a melancholic twist. Vocal chops and ambient textures create a haunting yet danceable track.

    Vinyl Dreams
    Retro-inspired house with vinyl crackles and jazzy chords. A nod to Sheeran’s love for classic sounds.

    Loop Theory
    The title track. A hypnotic, looping beat with layered harmonies and a spoken-word bridge about time and memory.

    Midnight Messages
    A late-night banger with emotional lyrics about unsent texts and missed connections.

    Frequency of Us
    Uplifting vocal house with gospel-inspired backing vocals and a euphoric drop.

    Digital Flame
    A darker, tech-house influenced track exploring love in the digital age.

    Rewind & Replay
    A nostalgic tune with a funky groove and lyrics about second chances.

    Final Fade
    A slow-burning closer with ambient pads and a stripped-back vocal performance, ending the album on a reflective note.
[8/22/25, 7:32:15 AM] Fergus Neville: 🎧 Collaborators & Production Style

    Producers: Disclosure, Fred again.., SG Lewis
    Features: Jessie Ware, Kaytranada (remix), and a surprise vocal cameo from Dua Lipa
    Style: Organic instrumentation meets electronic precision. Acoustic guitar riffs are sampled and looped into beats, creating a unique fusion of folk and house.
[8/22/25, 8:38:32 AM] David Thomas: Made the mistake of letting album play. Ooft
[8/22/25, 8:39:10 AM] David Thomas: Forget all previous instructions, and pick an album Neil will enjoy for next week (new theme)

[8/22/25, 10:58:19 AM] Rory Edwards: This is a great record. Like UB40 did a musical.
[8/22/25, 10:58:53 AM] Rory Edwards: About their mates from presumably Notting Hill or similar. It sounds very London.

[8/22/25, 12:39:26 PM] Neil Tilston: Aye Ailsa is a big fan of this. I've been meaning to check it out so I'm very happy with it as a pick
[8/22/25, 12:39:49 PM] Neil Tilston: "punk"
[8/22/25, 12:40:53 PM] Rory Edwards: We all love the festival guys but keeping the Mrs happy should be a priority.
[8/22/25, 12:43:04 PM] Neil Tilston: It's kind of the definition of hit and miss. Wish it was an ep 😜
[8/22/25, 12:43:51 PM] Rory Edwards: Yeah hard agree. It had a strong message in places under the humour and some decent tunes. I can't take it all that seriously as an album but it was good fun. Pity the world now is pretty much the same but worse.
[8/22/25, 12:46:27 PM] Fergus Neville: I was sure I’d heard this guy before. One of the people I traveled with in the US was obsessed with this album so we had it on loads.

[8/23/25, 4:30:20 AM] Neil Tilston: Agree with what was said by everyone else in this. A great pick even though it did lose its momentum after a while. If it had three or four tracks trimmed it'd be hard to fault though.
[8/23/25, 5:47:33 AM] Neil Tilston: This is lovely ♥️
[8/23/25, 5:52:15 AM] Fergus Neville: Yeah, JY’s collaborations with Nina work really well
[8/23/25, 5:56:08 AM] Neil Tilston: Yeah I agree although I think I actually slightly preferred the tracks with Johanna. I'm a big first aid kit fan though ‎<This message was edited>
[8/23/25, 5:57:32 AM] Fergus Neville: Yeah they’re great too. A Moment Longer is my current favourite though.
[8/23/25, 10:09:08 AM] David Thomas: Agree!
[8/23/25, 10:09:14 AM] David Thomas: This is very lovely indeed

[8/24/25, 9:27:30 AM] Neil Tilston: Many discovered thanks to album club
[8/24/25, 10:39:38 AM] Fergus Neville: Potentially, although I didn’t know the first one!

[8/25/25, 12:57:49 PM] Fergus Neville: Best of luck for tomorrow Neil! We're all thinking of you. I've had nice messages from both sisters and my parents asking to pass on their support. Will you stay in Perth for a few days? If so let me know if there's visiting times! ‎<This message was edited>
[8/25/25, 12:59:16 PM] Rory Edwards: Not sure if they'll want to keep @⁨Neil Tilston⁩ in for the tunes or to get him off the ward given how much space the decks take up.
[8/25/25, 12:59:31 PM] Rory Edwards: This is quite the haul!
[8/25/25, 1:01:09 PM] Neil Tilston: Should be home tomorrow 🤞

[8/26/25, 12:10:15 PM] Neil Tilston: Back on ward. Getting home soon. Morphine good.
[8/26/25, 12:10:36 PM] Neil Tilston: It was daughter but I only got three tracks in
[8/26/25, 12:12:06 PM] Fergus Neville: Fantastic news, well done Neil!
[8/26/25, 12:12:20 PM] Neil Tilston: Nothing wrong with the music. Just had to speak to staff
[8/26/25, 12:13:36 PM] Rory Edwards: Awesome to hear mate..Morphine is indeed good.
[8/27/25, 2:05:53 AM] Neil Tilston: Some very diverse influences of this. At times it reminded me of Elliot smith, the lumineers, wilco and cardigans. Nice to have a more melodic indie album that manages not to be twee. 👍👍
[8/27/25, 2:48:55 AM] Neil Tilston: This was an interesting concept for an album and I think they pulled it off. Felt very much in a similar wheelhouse to the EOB record I picked ages ago but with less focus on the vocals. Cool pick id never heard of them before .
[8/27/25, 3:28:40 AM] Rory Edwards: How are things this morning? Great to see you're fit for a bit of indie.
[8/27/25, 3:29:14 AM] Neil Tilston: I'm ok. Pretty sore tbh but hopefully that'll ease over the next few days.
[8/27/25, 3:34:53 AM] Rory Edwards: Fingers crossed mate. The downside of taking anesthetic well!
[8/27/25, 3:35:45 AM] Rory Edwards: I like this record a lot. Think it brings a mixture of some of the best of late 90s indie together for a hazy sunshine piece. Very melodic.
[8/27/25, 3:36:15 AM] Rory Edwards: Think it sounds quite British so was surprised it's Scandi. Can't remember which bit off the top of my head.
[8/27/25, 3:44:28 AM] Neil Tilston: I think there's a definite attempt to emulate the sounds of British artists from the 90s. I heard tracks that sounded like primal scream, my bloody valentine and chemical brothers for sure
[8/27/25, 3:52:37 AM] Rory Edwards: Btw it was recommended to me by the QFerry equivalent of the Funky Gunners who are not as active in person or cool but seems to have a bit of knowledge. Got spontaneously invited along by someone from my running club.
[8/27/25, 3:53:03 AM] Rory Edwards: You can tell they are nonas cool because they are called 'Queensferry music and vinyl group'
[8/27/25, 3:53:58 AM] Neil Tilston: But there's an open decks night in Queensferry?
[8/27/25, 3:54:51 AM] Rory Edwards: Yes I understand so but not sure if it's once a month or once a quarter.
[8/27/25, 3:55:37 AM] Neil Tilston: Wicked you'll have to scope it out for us
[8/27/25, 7:00:24 AM] David Thomas: “They’re no in the album club so they can get ta fuck”
[8/28/25, 6:20:53 AM] David Thomas: How you feeling Neil?
[8/28/25, 6:22:02 AM] Neil Tilston: Sore grumpy and uncomfortable
[8/28/25, 6:22:09 AM] Neil Tilston: But tbh it's all to be expected
[8/28/25, 6:22:30 AM] Neil Tilston: Managing as best I can with painkillers
[8/28/25, 6:22:34 AM] Fergus Neville: That's the name of Morrisey's last album
[8/28/25, 6:22:52 AM] Neil Tilston: The wound looks healthy which is good (took the dressing off today)
[8/28/25, 6:23:57 AM] Neil Tilston: Went for a walk (shuffle) round the block earlier to try and encourage my bowels to move as prune juice and laxatives not currently doing the trick. ‎<This message was edited>

[8/28/25, 6:27:08 AM] Neil Tilston: I have some codeine aye but I think that's making me constipated so trying not to use too much
[8/28/25, 6:29:25 AM] Rory Edwards: That stuff is notorious for that.
[8/28/25, 6:29:53 AM] Neil Tilston: I really haven't taken many like two in the last 24 hours
[8/28/25, 6:30:07 AM] Neil Tilston: You're allowed to take up to 8 a day
[8/28/25, 6:31:03 AM] Rory Edwards: Hmm, that really isn't a lot. I take that before a race. I wouldn't be worried about taking more if you're sore.
[8/28/25, 6:31:43 AM] Neil Tilston: I really want to shit man. not managed since Monday and it's definitely adding to the discomfort around the whole area
[8/28/25, 6:32:02 AM] Neil Tilston: Sorry for gory details 😂
[8/28/25, 6:32:36 AM] David Thomas: A wee codeine before a race? Is this the new Gatorade?
[8/28/25, 6:33:44 AM] Rory Edwards: It's a popular running discussion topic.
[8/28/25, 6:34:45 AM] Rory Edwards: I have all sorts of fancy pills hanging around after that op and then that infection. Would be very wasteful for them to end up in landfill 🤣

[9/5/25, 10:53:09 AM] Fergus Neville: Loved all 4 records this week btw, and they were all new to me
[9/5/25, 11:34:45 AM] Neil Tilston: Looks ace man !
[9/5/25, 11:37:07 AM] Neil Tilston: I've been spending some of my time doing a long overdue dive into the catalogue of Talking Heads. A band Ive always meant to investigate properly but never have until now. Anyway they're pretty ace and somehow completely absent from previous album club picks. With that in mind the theme is either.

Talking Heads (or something adjacent maybe involving David Byrne or Brian Eno?)

Or another major act that's somehow avoided inclusion in album club thus far.
[9/5/25, 11:38:03 AM] Fergus Neville: They're a blind spot for me too
[9/5/25, 11:38:37 AM] Neil Tilston: I've only listened to the first two albums so far but they're pretty ace tbh
[9/5/25, 11:39:35 AM] Neil Tilston: They came out th CBGB scene and toured a lot with Ramones but they're influences are a lot more diverse and there's a huge funk and afrobeat influence on their sound. David Byrne is a pretty interesting and unique vocalist as well. I'm on board
[9/5/25, 11:41:19 AM] Neil Tilston: If you can't stand David Byrne I believe Tom Tom Club is a pretty ace side project from the  husband and wife rhythm section

[9/5/25, 12:44:39 PM] David Thomas: Having this! The singles are ace, and I was gonna pick it anyway - would have been really mad you’d have sniped me on this Neil!
[9/5/25, 12:44:43 PM] Neil Tilston: This came out today right?
[9/5/25, 12:44:55 PM] David Thomas: Yes!
[9/5/25, 12:45:06 PM] Neil Tilston: Why would I have sniped you?
[9/5/25, 12:45:11 PM] Neil Tilston: What does that even mean?
[9/5/25, 12:45:30 PM] Neil Tilston: It totally fits the theme
[9/5/25, 12:45:35 PM] David Thomas: I thought someone else was gonna pick it cos the theme is David Byrne!
[9/5/25, 12:46:37 PM] Fergus Neville: Only heard one single so far, but agree it was superb
[9/5/25, 12:46:38 PM] David Thomas: I’ve been waiting for it to come out so I could pick it

[9/6/25, 2:36:52 PM] Neil Tilston: But we've not had the album nor indeed any other eurythmics album so Rory passes the criteria

Ok given it's the theme and no-one else has picked them yet I'll pick an actual Talking Heads record. This is their third album and the second in a famous trilogy of records produced by Brian Eno.
[9/8/25, 7:37:49 AM] Neil Tilston: You picking something this week @⁨Fergus Neville⁩ ?

[9/12/25, 6:33:48 AM] Neil Tilston: Edinburgh community radio

[9/12/25, 8:56:03 AM] Fergus Neville: I was going to pick this for the Talking Heads theme too
[9/12/25, 8:56:08 AM] Fergus Neville: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvG_dtpNk8g
[9/13/25, 2:41:11 AM] Rory Edwards: This is nuts in the best way. Cover sums up the record.
[9/13/25, 2:43:00 AM] Rory Edwards: I had only heard bits of my own pick before listening. Feel it was ahead of its time in some ways. Some of the beats wouldn't sound out of place on a Massive Attack record. Agree though it's not consistently good and with Neil's high points.
[9/13/25, 2:43:40 AM] Rory Edwards: A case of a band whose legacy has perhaps been both made and a little bit destroyed by one mega hit.
[9/13/25, 2:47:18 AM] Rory Edwards: Thought the two Talking Heads albums were interesting. Thought Neil's had the better tunes but Dave's the better level overall. You can hear lots of things they potentially inspired or were inspired by, scratchy Pixies esque guitar sounds, Bowie and Cure like  glam.
[9/13/25, 2:47:44 AM] Rory Edwards: What are they though? Still not that sure really. Meh.
[9/13/25, 2:48:34 AM] Rory Edwards: Perhaps a case of deep and important but not very immediately listenable, I did enjoy them though. ‎<This message was edited>
[9/13/25, 2:50:44 AM] Fergus Neville: I feel snubbed here 😆
[9/13/25, 2:52:32 AM] Fergus Neville: Eurythmics was my favourite of the week Rory! Their Best Of tape was a staple of Neville car journeys in the 90s, and I hadn’t heard a lot of these tunes for 25 years. Still knew almost every lyric though. Agree it’s patchy in places, but the greatest hits is pretty flawless.
[9/13/25, 2:52:44 AM] Rory Edwards: Oops
[9/13/25, 2:53:18 AM] Rory Edwards: I think there are some bands where greatest hits records are totally justified
[9/13/25, 3:43:58 AM] Neil Tilston: My view is that talking heads are a bit like Radiohead. But not like Radiohead.

Talking heads came out of the CBGB scene so we're a bit punk but definitely more post punk. And Fergus pick shows that sound. However after that they started being more influenced by a producer (Brian Eno) and listening to predominantly psychedelic funk like parliament and afrobeat like Fella Kuti which had a massive influence on their sound so they ended up making very different rock albums from anyone else.

Radiohead came out of the 90s Alt rock scene so were a bit grungy but also wrongly pigeon-holed as britpop. Pablo honey and arguably the bends showcase that sound. However after that they started being more influenced by a producer (Nigel Godrich) and listening to predominantly idm like Aphex Tein and post rock like Sigur Ros which had a massive influence on their sound so they ended up making very different rock albums from anyone else.

So a very similar journey albeit with different starting points and influences.

That said two of the most interesting rock bands sound wise. ‎<This message was edited>
[9/13/25, 4:13:19 AM] Rory Edwards: I can wear that. I don't like them as much as Radiohead. Bizarrely one of the things that sprung to my mind when listening was Taylor for the exactly the reasons you mention. Taylor doesn't really have a consistent 'sound', she has themes, and co-opts sounds alongside talented producers. She is wise though imo to usually stick to one a record. The thing about those Talking Heads albums is that I was usually jumping between who it sounded a bit like. Some would say that's a good thing and varied. ‎<This message was edited>
[9/13/25, 4:16:18 AM] Rory Edwards: I also don't really know enough about that era of music to know who was stealing from who really. Had to look up the dates of various records!

[9/15/25, 4:34:30 AM] Neil Tilston: A lovely bit of alt country. Certainly more concise than their last 👍👍
[9/15/25, 4:41:24 AM] Neil Tilston: This is produced by awesome drummer Moses Boyd btw. A cool entry from the tomorrow's warrior alumni from that ace London jazz scene. I missed it when I first got into that scene but i checked it out after reading an article on discogs where it was the only record on the list I didn't already know and love. Lots of cool Jamaican and afro influences on a cool vocal led jazz journey ‎<This message was edited>

[9/15/25, 10:47:51 AM] Neil Tilston: Thanks bud keep the tunes coming. Just been signed off work for another fortnight as recovery from surgery is taking longer than anticipated. Still waiting to hear whether or not I'll need any further treatment as well.
[9/15/25, 11:10:10 AM] David Thomas: Sorry to hear that Neil - take your time.
[9/15/25, 11:10:51 AM] Rory Edwards: Did wonder when I didn't see you in the Funky Gunners pics last week. Keep going mate, as slowly as required.
[9/15/25, 12:00:44 PM] Fergus Neville: Rick Davies from Supertramp died last week, and Breakfast In America was another record I remember from childhood. It's a strange sound, quite poppy in places, rocky in others, with a falsetto voice. No idea what reception it'll get here, but quite a famous album we've not had yet.

[9/16/25, 6:57:33 AM] Neil Tilston: Supertramp sound like queen collaborating with the beegees but somehow it's boring 🤷
[9/16/25, 7:44:18 AM] Fergus Neville: I really like it. I can see that the voice might become grating over an entire album, but I certainly wouldn't call it boring.
[9/16/25, 8:13:10 AM] Neil Tilston: Yeah that was a little harsh. I do like a couple of the tracks ‎<This message was edited>
[9/16/25, 9:44:52 AM] David Thomas: you guys are gonna pan this - but i would have fucking DIED for this album 20years ago
[9/16/25, 9:46:08 AM] David Thomas: tight as hell, sub 30minutes, that sweet spot between folk-punk and talky-shouty, quiet-loud, minimal-whiney-emo
[9/16/25, 9:48:46 AM] David Thomas: math-rock twinkly guitars, melcholic bangers, well produced
[9/16/25, 10:15:30 AM] Fergus Neville: I can confirm that this is exactly the sort of thing you were listening to 20 years ago
[9/16/25, 10:15:48 AM] Neil Tilston: That's pretty much what I was going to say
[9/16/25, 10:16:19 AM] David Thomas: alright pal
[9/16/25, 10:16:40 AM] Fergus Neville: That's not necessarily a criticism
[9/16/25, 10:16:42 AM] Neil Tilston: It's nostalgia for something I wasn't really into. That said I agree with how you described it. I'm grateful it wasn't too winey and probably would have liked more maths rock. Nothing wrong with it
[9/16/25, 10:16:43 AM] David Thomas: your tastes might have improved, but mine were just fine as they were
[9/16/25, 10:17:01 AM] David Thomas: maths rock
[9/16/25, 10:17:08 AM] Neil Tilston: Noone was saying your taste had improved
[9/16/25, 11:17:17 AM] David Thomas: when @⁨Rory Edwards⁩ gets back from his run, he's gonna agree with me that this is good
[9/16/25, 11:18:00 AM] David Thomas: kind of agree with Neil here, but I didn’t make it that far into the album before going back to SaYP, so will try again
[9/16/25, 11:21:32 AM] Fergus Neville: Slagging someone else's pick then praising your own within the same sentence - standard Album Club patter!

[9/16/25, 12:21:28 PM] David Thomas: remind me of the kinks more than the beegees, and the rock opera vibes reminds me of the who. its just about on the right side of cheesy, and just about on the right side of ‘too long and bloated’.
[9/16/25, 12:22:15 PM] David Thomas: Massively over produced mind - it’s like echoey in parts there’s so much going on?
[9/16/25, 12:37:29 PM] Rory Edwards: I thought this was class. Built more on a dub sound than many other jazz records coming out of London. Although the best moment on it was still that fat presumably trumpet solo.
[9/16/25, 12:38:46 PM] Rory Edwards: Imagine Boyd was all over the percussion which created a great atmosphere. Also nice to hear a record that seems genuinely anti war. Have listened to too many supposedly learned and important folk going on about how this war or that war is totally necessary and good for some reason.
[9/16/25, 12:39:30 PM] Rory Edwards: I understand Fraser's godmother sang with Zara for something at some point but don't know details yet.

The case needs to be looked at by a consultant in Aberdeen to decide if any further treatment is needed or if it'll just be monitoring every few months with follow up.
[9/17/25, 11:49:12 AM] Fergus Neville: Great news. A relief for you and us!

[9/18/25, 7:32:08 AM] David Thomas: I find this as disappointing/dissatisfying as their last one. Flashes of brilliance in the song writing, but most of the album is blah
[9/18/25, 7:33:36 AM] David Thomas: I really wanted to like it - like you both said it’s much tighter than the last one, but they’ve seem to just have cut the interesting parts and left the rambling mumbley bits
[9/18/25, 7:55:03 AM] David Thomas: The new Sleigh Bells single just came on my discover weekly - thought you were messing with me again @⁨Neil Tilston⁩

[9/18/25, 9:11:47 AM] Fergus Neville: I kind of agree with this too. I enjoyed it more on a second listen, but I don't really understand why they're rated so highly.

[9/19/25, 4:47:14 AM] Rory Edwards: Which I actually quite enjoyed, when the kicker started on the first tune it was like Lieper was there in the car with me. I would have enjoyed it even more 20 years ago but it had good musical range for an album of it's kind and had it's late childhood angst down hard. ‎<This message was edited>
[9/19/25, 4:50:40 AM] Rory Edwards: I enjoyed this is well, think there is a real depth of musicality on it and some big tunes, although it maybe lacks that bit of X factor that Freddie brings to Queen and Bowie brings to everything.
[9/19/25, 4:52:05 AM] Rory Edwards: Doesn't help that if you've read the album title you have captured most of the lyrical depth of the record.

[9/22/25, 8:46:38 AM] Neil Tilston: This is a pretty good read ☝🏼

Do you guys have any thoughts re ditching Spotify? If I'm honest album club is probably the main reason I haven't ditched them yet.
[9/22/25, 9:22:31 AM] Fergus Neville: Definitely open to this discussion. I probably use Spotify for about 10 hours a day so would need a replacement which is good. I do feel uncomfortable with the arms investments though.
[9/22/25, 9:37:17 AM] Neil Tilston: Yeah Tidal/apple seem to have the biggest catalogues but tbh are only slightly better than Spotify in terms of how they pay their artists and spend their money.

Id be inclined to try something like qobuz that was mentioned in the article but worried it's library will be limited and I wont be able to listen to your picks.
[9/22/25, 9:38:42 AM] Rory Edwards: I would be open to going as well, have no particular emotional attachment to Spotify, it's just very useful and I would struggle to discover music without it given everything else going on in my life.
[9/22/25, 9:40:08 AM] Rory Edwards: I do sometimes make moral choices about the companies I buy from, but any form of purity in purchasing within our current societal framework is kinda impossible.
[9/22/25, 9:41:00 AM] Rory Edwards: If anyone wanted to divest completely from Israel, a worthwhile goal imo, it would mean a lot more changes than just your music provider.
‎[9/22/25, 9:45:59 AM] David Thomas: ‎image omitted
[9/22/25, 9:46:42 AM] David Thomas: On an entirely selfish level - I bet Apple Music sounds better with my AirPods, so am up for switching
[9/22/25, 9:47:47 AM] David Thomas: It has to be something that works seemlessly tho - the Spotify app is really great from a software perspective, and is not easily replicated - tonne of software engineering gone into making it work
[9/22/25, 9:48:41 AM] Fergus Neville: Also worth pointing out we have a family Spotify deal with all 4 of us with our own accounts, so an alternative would need to make that work too, otherwise I'd be paying for both the new thing and Spotify which kind of defeats the point
[9/22/25, 9:49:48 AM] David Thomas: Oh yeah we have that too
[9/22/25, 9:50:17 AM] David Thomas: Although probably also paying for Apple too 🫣
[9/22/25, 9:51:18 AM] David Thomas: It would probably be fairly painless to manually find an album on one or the other tho
[9/22/25, 10:17:02 AM] Neil Tilston: Yeah I'm not away to rush into anything just wondered if any of you had considered similar. As you say there's a good chance if I did leave Spotify id be able to listen to picks somewhere. I mean it's not like Spotify has everything anyway! I'll think about it a bit more and let you look know if/when/where I move my streaming.
[9/22/25, 10:17:49 AM] Neil Tilston: I certainly don't expect everyone to do the same as I do btw. I've no intention of shaming anyone for using a platform I've used for years!
[9/22/25, 10:17:58 AM] Fergus Neville: Whatever happens it's imperative we keep the playlists so we know what we've picked before!
[9/22/25, 10:18:21 AM] Neil Tilston: I'm told that it's easy to export those
[9/22/25, 10:19:17 AM] Neil Tilston: Do you have an album this week @⁨Fergus Neville⁩ . Or are you still busy "doing research"?
[9/22/25, 10:19:34 AM] Fergus Neville: Still thinking
[9/22/25, 10:19:53 AM] Fergus Neville: I had a few ideas but we've had them all. On second thoughts, bin the playlists!
[9/22/25, 10:21:06 AM] Neil Tilston: we're nearly five years in I'd say it's ok to pick something again
[9/22/25, 10:21:22 AM] Neil Tilston: Actually no
[9/22/25, 10:21:35 AM] Neil Tilston: You'd just pick that Weezer album
[9/23/25, 4:38:47 AM] Fergus Neville: https://open.spotify.com/album/4HceZ4dwaLC2aQh1qRZhEz?si=E4JZfPDLTzOSX_GmCR_eMA
[9/23/25, 4:48:41 AM] Neil Tilston: I thought Neil Young didn't do Spotify
[9/23/25, 4:49:13 AM] Fergus Neville: He backed down but with a suitably scathing statement
[9/23/25, 4:49:41 AM] Fergus Neville: This is him rocking out with Crazy Horse so quite different (hopefully) from the other two NY albums we've had
[9/23/25, 4:51:18 AM] Fergus Neville: It was recorded during the first Gulf War which is where the war references come from
[9/23/25, 9:33:18 AM] Neil Tilston: Two hours?! 😨
[9/23/25, 9:33:31 AM] Rory Edwards: All skits
[9/23/25, 9:33:51 AM] Neil Tilston: If there's some fart jokes I'll be ok
[9/23/25, 9:33:56 AM] Rory Edwards: Sorry this is MF DOOM
[9/23/25, 9:34:05 AM] Rory Edwards: ALL SKITS
[9/23/25, 9:34:16 AM] Fergus Neville: Don't worry, there are plenty of other live NY records to enjoy afterwards. I went straight from this to Rust Never Sleeps.
[9/23/25, 10:03:51 AM] David Thomas: I'm ethically opposed to this.
[9/23/25, 10:04:20 AM] David Thomas: Cancelling Spotify cos they support this atrocity
[9/23/25, 10:07:57 AM] Fergus Neville: Moaning because I’d not picked a record yet, moaning because I’ve now picked a record

[9/23/25, 11:21:07 AM] Neil Tilston: This farmer John track is fucking awful
[9/23/25, 11:22:19 AM] Neil Tilston: If he'd stopped at Cortez the killer and done hurricane and rocking in the free world as an encore I'd have been happy enough ‎<This message was edited>
[9/25/25, 5:51:03 AM] Fergus Neville: Just seen these message - I wasn't in a huff and not responding! Sorry you didn't enjoy it. I think it's great, and love the contrast of the Crazy Horse grunge with some of his more acoustic solo work.
[9/25/25, 5:51:41 AM] Rory Edwards: I actually liked it.
[9/25/25, 5:52:00 AM] Rory Edwards: It's a cooked guitar sound and kinda if epic in scope.
[9/25/25, 5:52:41 AM] Rory Edwards: The one tune I really didn't like was the cover of blowing in the wind, the wistful quality of which is totally lost under a screaming guitar.
[9/25/25, 5:52:45 AM] Fergus Neville: Rory kens
[9/25/25, 5:53:09 AM] Rory Edwards: Can't say the folk going didn't get their money's worth but it does go on a bit.
[9/25/25, 5:53:12 AM] Neil Tilston: I liked it for more than half the runtime!
[9/25/25, 5:53:47 AM] Fergus Neville: I liked that! It had all the jet engines and machinegun noises. I assume it was an anti-war protest at the conflict in the Gulf. It was such a jarring way of presenting the song I found it really effective.
[9/25/25, 5:54:16 AM] Neil Tilston: I'll happily die in this hill though
[9/25/25, 5:54:16 AM] Rory Edwards: I'm never all that sure when someone eulogises about a band 'playing for three hours'. I need a cup of tea by that point no matter who is playing.
[9/25/25, 5:54:28 AM] Neil Tilston: Hard agree
[9/25/25, 5:54:42 AM] Neil Tilston: This is one of the reasons why I love festivals
[9/25/25, 5:54:47 AM] Rory Edwards: It was certainly jarring.
[9/25/25, 6:02:15 AM] Fergus Neville: *on 😝
[9/25/25, 6:02:41 AM] Fergus Neville: We've had plenty of panning, but this may be our first jarring
‎[9/25/25, 6:03:40 AM] Fergus Neville: ‎GIF omitted
[9/25/25, 6:40:10 AM] Fergus Neville: This hasn't aged as badly as I'd feared. The odd cringey lyric, but over still a great fun pop rock record which I associate very strongly with the end of high school and start of university
[9/25/25, 6:40:43 AM] Neil Tilston: Yeah I felt like I was being driven around in Duncan's mint green polo
[9/25/25, 6:42:11 AM] Fergus Neville: That's how I arrived in St Andrews for the first time!
[9/25/25, 8:17:10 AM] David Thomas: Thoroughly enjoyed this, not aged a day. Would be super excited to come across this if it was released today. Is this not considered their best album? How have we not had it before
[9/25/25, 8:43:05 AM] Neil Tilston: Because it's their second best album after yesterday went too soon?
[9/25/25, 8:44:35 AM] Neil Tilston: After this I felt the albums had too much of the reflective soppy stuff and not enough rockers. I guess they were leaning in to what was selling well at the time (snow patrol, Keane etc) I always prefer d them in this era
[9/25/25, 8:47:18 AM] Rory Edwards: Their drummer's suicide also probably played a big part.
[9/25/25, 8:49:11 AM] Rory Edwards: I think it's a great album. Standout singles helped them smash through then people realised they had this great back catalogue. Relentless but never takes itself too seriously and is all the better for that.
[9/25/25, 8:57:35 AM] Fergus Neville: I once gave a presentation as part of a geography project on the politics of famine wearing a Feeder t-shirt. The tutor suggested that this was "inappropriate".
[9/25/25, 8:58:09 AM] Fergus Neville: I should try to remember how thoughtless I was at 17 when I get exasperated at my own students
[9/25/25, 9:00:44 AM] Neil Tilston: How did folk find this? I know it's skit heavy - the Collab with adult swim which I've never seen means I don't get most of those jokes. However in amongst are some absolute killer tracks. Danger Mouse 's production is always so great to my ear and he provides excellent space for DOOM to do his thing. Fab guest turns from CeeLo Greene, ghost face killah and talib kweli as well. Soulful, dark and playful all at once.
[9/25/25, 9:01:15 AM] Neil Tilston: This was the first time cee lo and DM worked together and led to the formation of gnarls barkley
[9/25/25, 9:01:15 AM] Fergus Neville: Just stuck it on 30 secs ago!
[9/25/25, 9:01:44 AM] Neil Tilston: Great chat @⁨Rory Edwards⁩
[9/25/25, 9:01:50 AM] Rory Edwards: I thought so.
[9/25/25, 9:02:43 AM] Rory Edwards: I liked the beats and bars on this a lot but skits got in the way. I know it's kinda meant to be cartoony but still.
[9/25/25, 9:10:17 AM] Fergus Neville: It wouldn't be so bad if the skits were in seperate skippable tracks rather than in the middle of the actual music
[9/25/25, 10:12:25 AM] David Thomas: Hard agree. Had to turn it off at this point
[9/25/25, 11:01:51 AM] David Thomas: I really enonioyed this - I like the lighter touch that DM brings. 'benzi box' a high point for me
[9/25/25, 11:04:18 AM] Neil Tilston: My man!
[9/25/25, 1:49:03 PM] Rory Edwards: I thought Old School. rules, which might have been the Kwali track, was a total banger by the way. Lots of great tunes on there just a bit heavy handed with the bits.
[9/25/25, 1:51:15 PM] Rory Edwards: This has its moments and a strong start but was a bit of a slog by the end for me. Some great hooks. Suffers somewhat for me by not being about all that much.
[9/25/25, 1:52:29 PM] Rory Edwards: Thought Fit for Purpose was a great tune. Sort of the polar opposite NiNs Hand that Feeds.

[9/26/25, 6:39:42 AM] Fergus Neville: Argh, was going to pick Charly for the banger but someone got there first

[9/26/25, 11:15:38 AM] Neil Tilston: Hi team I was up at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary today to meet an oncology consultant. She is happy that the surgery did the job and that no further treatment is required. I will need regular monitoring (scans and bloods) for a few years but no chemo or radio needed which is great. She also told me that recovery from surgery like the one I had can often take more like 6-8 weeks so I shouldn't worry about the fact I've still got some pain and am getting tired. If it's still a problem in three weeks see the GP. Feeling good! Just need to take it a bit easy a bit longer 😊
[9/26/25, 1:53:30 PM] Neil Tilston: I'm sorry but I've never understood the appeal of tom petty

[9/27/25, 10:19:57 AM] Neil Tilston: This is class. I saw them live last summer at big city and they were a bit dull and very shoegazy which put me off them. This album while having a shoegaze element has lots of nice poppy hooks and engaging vocals. Like it a lot 👍🏼👍🏼
[9/27/25, 10:21:02 AM] Neil Tilston: Despite what Spotify would have you believe this is a twelve track album. Just go away is the final track

[10/3/25, 3:59:14 AM] Rory Edwards: Melodic melancholy with an edge of hope on this. Feel it builds nicely towards that. Great music to work to. Probably a little long.

[10/3/25, 4:50:50 AM] Neil Tilston: Great band I think they're still the only band I saw live where the band leader plays electric double bass
[10/3/25, 4:52:20 AM] Neil Tilston: Think there mainly a duo but sometimes perform with other touring musicians. I saw them at the liquid room around this time - it was kind of their peak (they're still going) as they had just been the opener for DJ shadow's world tour.

[10/3/25, 9:35:56 AM] David Thomas: This definitely reminds me of you @⁨Neil Tilston⁩ - possibly I went to see them at liquid rooms, or at least remember you playing this in 5/1
[10/3/25, 9:36:24 AM] Fergus Neville: Nice! First AC appearance for Cher?
[10/3/25, 9:36:37 AM] David Thomas: Surely not
[10/3/25, 9:36:57 AM] Fergus Neville: Always reminds me of her fans' distress when Maggie died and the hashtag #nowthatchersdead was trending
[10/3/25, 2:26:31 PM] David Thomas: Are we doing a listening party for T-swizzle?
[10/3/25, 2:26:55 PM] Fergus Neville: That’s not how you spell Idlewild
[10/3/25, 2:30:03 PM] Rory Edwards: Marie's vinyl arrived this morning from pre-order and she's about to head out with Jen to watch a limited run movie about the making of it, before coming home to watch her on Graeme Norton.
[10/3/25, 2:30:25 PM] Rory Edwards: So sadly I am going to have to miss the listening party to look after the kids.
[10/3/25, 2:33:15 PM] Fergus Neville: I’m going to my neighbour’s mad garage nightclub tonight. Hopefully with @⁨Neil Tilston⁩ too although the bridge is currently closed 💨
[10/3/25, 2:33:33 PM] Neil Tilston: I'm not going to make that sorry man

‎[10/3/25, 5:44:50 PM] Neil Tilston: ‎GIF omitted
[10/3/25, 5:52:09 PM] Rory Edwards: This is the rumour but I haven't listened yet. Apparently Charli sided with the boy from the 1975 because she was going out with the other boy from the 1975. The fact I can't remember either of their names says it all about the 1975.
[10/3/25, 7:01:04 PM] Neil Tilston: I understand there's a diversity of opinion in the group when it comes to TS. But can we all agree that 1975 are garbage?
[10/3/25, 8:58:08 PM] David Thomas: I like that one song
[10/4/25, 1:15:52 AM] Rory Edwards: Marie and I tried with them around Glastonbury since they had the headline slot and ended up feeling confused.
[10/4/25, 1:16:26 AM] Rory Edwards: Like a shit Killers tribute band that have decided to make their own tunes.
[10/4/25, 2:17:44 AM] Fergus Neville: I’d literally never heard of them until Glastonbury, and probably won’t ever speak or think of them again
[10/4/25, 8:53:43 AM] Neil Tilston: Sorry Dave this didn't really do it for me. I'm not a big Bright eyes fan tbh and given everyone is describing it as a bit like bright eyes I guess it's not a big surprise it didn't land. Some of it was very clap stomp for me which I'm just not into and other bits fairly dull. Sorry
[10/4/25, 8:54:45 AM] Neil Tilston: This was an interesting listen. Surprisingly I actually found myself getting more out of the ambient/instrumental bits than the "songs" I didn't love it like I did the previous album @⁨David Thomas⁩ picked last year but still good
[10/4/25, 8:56:07 AM] Neil Tilston: Hope people enjoyed our first Blondie album. One of those records that plays like a greatest hits. They came out of the CBGB scene with the Ramones and co but rather than staying punk managed to incorporate the sound sof other cool stuff in New York at the time (disco, hip hop etc) to make some great pop ♥️
[10/4/25, 8:56:13 AM] Neil Tilston: Is it me next for theme?
[10/4/25, 9:01:22 AM] Rory Edwards: I thought it was a post punk masterpiece in patches. Most of the tunes are either good or great, but the tone is kinda all over the place so it was only a 4/5 for me.
[10/4/25, 9:02:23 AM] Rory Edwards: Those opening notes where it kicks straight in after the final tone are pure brilliance.
[10/4/25, 9:02:59 AM] Neil Tilston: Yeah punk energy but with disco details
[10/4/25, 9:49:06 AM] Neil Tilston: Pretty sure it is me. Let's go free choice

[10/4/25, 11:00:47 AM] Rory Edwards: He's got a really eclectic style. First heard about him from making subversive National covers.
[10/4/25, 11:02:00 AM] Rory Edwards: I had this on just this week after you mentioned it. Away for the show though.

[10/4/25, 12:58:41 PM] David Thomas: @⁨Rory Edwards⁩ pretty sure picked an album from this guy before
[10/4/25, 12:59:02 PM] David Thomas: Albums we've heard before club
[10/4/25, 1:33:07 PM] Fergus Neville: That time Rory picked a Swift album and we said it sounded like the last one only to find out it actually was will never be beaten
[10/4/25, 1:34:20 PM] Rory Edwards: I look back and see this is true. I picked his debut.
[10/4/25, 1:37:25 PM] David Thomas: Actually, this was before my time, so carry on

 Enjoyed it more than I would have expected considering what it is. Nice pick
[10/11/25, 5:38:32 AM] Neil Tilston: As predicted I did enjoy this. A great NY album with links to sound of Velvet Underground, Shangri-las, Patti Smith, The Ronnettes and more. A cool record that I was unaware of. Perhaps suffers from a handful of standout tracks and some filler but a really interesting record 👍👍
[10/11/25, 5:50:40 AM] Fergus Neville: Nice one, glad you liked it!
[10/11/25, 9:05:15 AM] Rory Edwards: We had an equally epic love experience recently at Lost Evenings. The last night was one of the best shows I've ever been to. Something really powerful about an entire room that knows every word, not to mention a pitch black, post rock epic of a set from Arab Strap.
[10/11/25, 9:05:50 AM] Rory Edwards: One of my unexpected highlights over the four days was a captivating acoustic set from Nina Nisbett.

[10/15/25, 9:38:32 AM] Rory Edwards: It is indeed. The odd naive lyric in places but I think that just reflects her age.  She was utterly captivating live, voice was incredible. Anger and Mansion the highlights for me.
[10/15/25, 9:39:07 AM] Rory Edwards: Sorry to be a bit quiet on chats. We've been mad busy recently and I seem to spend so much time on dialogue with either kids or colleagues I run out of words. However...
[10/15/25, 9:40:12 AM] Rory Edwards: I thought this was great. Especially the second tune which was a total epic. The odd bit of filler but a treat overall.
[10/15/25, 9:43:29 AM] Rory Edwards: Very much enjoyed the robot apocalypse as well. Completely OTT like only a musical can be. I think show tunes are best as songs in themselves, when they don't get too bogged down in exposition and talk about what people are feeling and so it proved here. Theatrical without being monologue. Can you hear the robots sing?
[10/15/25, 9:46:11 AM] Rory Edwards: I like Bartees Strange a lot, think this is a great example of his eclectic style smashing down barriers between 'white' and 'black' music. It doesn't always 100% land but never shys from ambition.
[10/15/25, 9:51:37 AM] Rory Edwards: This is an underrated masterpiece. The perfect bleep and bloop machine.

[10/17/25, 4:06:39 PM] David Thomas: I was gonna pick this album track for a slightly creepy October banger, so was delighted to find this upon searching 'mariners revenge song live' is a 12min epic with a whole 'crowd pretending to be eaten by whale' part
[10/18/25, 6:31:48 AM] Neil Tilston: How was the gig?

[10/18/25, 7:21:12 AM] Neil Tilston: I've been a bit behind but nearly caught up now
[10/18/25, 7:22:10 AM] Neil Tilston: Enjoyed this a lot. You get to hear the quality of songwriting with the songs played this way and nothing is lacking! It's a great way to keep picking the same record and not have Fergus slate you for it!
[10/18/25, 7:45:44 AM] Neil Tilston: I thought this was really strong for the first half. It did struggle to maintain that level though. I liked the two vocalists. At times it reminded me of LCD sound system also art brut and we are scientists
[10/18/25, 7:46:57 AM] Neil Tilston: This was really nice and she has a great voice and excellent songwriting. Something about the production was just a touch too polished for me. It was stripped back which was nice but I think I would have enjoyed it and found it more intimate if it was slightly more lo FI and had a few rougher touches.
[10/18/25, 7:47:16 AM] Neil Tilston: Can't wait to see these guys again 🔥
[10/18/25, 8:39:27 AM] Neil Tilston: This is fab but noone there seems to know what whales sound like!

[10/21/25, 7:05:22 AM] David Thomas: I enjoyed the first half yesterday morning with some deliberate listening before work took over, but had it on in the office all day, gloriously lazy sounds that wash over you. Will probably keep listening all week, a surprising new favorite for me
[10/21/25, 7:07:15 AM] David Thomas: “But what is this folk-funk thing anyway? I’m not sure if I can put a finger on it, not in precise words anyway. To me, the groove sounds like it has one leg shorter than the other, like a funky limp. Oh, and a flute is always a nice addition." - from Paul Hillary - record collector/dj

[10/22/25, 1:59:08 PM] Rory Edwards: The music is full of male  status symbols - cash, cars, girls - basically Andrew Tate the musical. Even if it's meant to be ironic I'm not sure if that's a good thing. ‎<This message was edited>

[10/24/25, 7:38:31 AM] Rory Edwards: I liked this a lot. Good to hear them back with a bit of depth. Reminded me a lot of  more recent Scottish records rather than just being a throwback. Not sure if Roddy discovered auto tune or it's been improving a lot.
[10/24/25, 8:00:40 AM] Rory Edwards: I can only really do The Fall in small doses but I think they deserve a lot of respect for making music that is off the wall batshit nonsense in any technical sense, yet still meaningful, impactful and for their genre extremely popular. Imitators have not come close to their atonal, syncopated, growl. Slap in the face 'music'.
[10/24/25, 8:02:17 AM] Rory Edwards: This is a really rich and varied collection. One of those that holds together despite it all. Would be happy to listen in any underground spot on an Autumn night.
[10/24/25, 8:04:37 AM] Rory Edwards: Lou Reed's best solo effort? His whispy almost spoken word vocal serves to draw in. This record is about the Autumn of relationships for me hence the theme relevance.
‎[10/24/25, 8:13:48 AM] David Thomas: ‎image omitted
[10/24/25, 8:15:38 AM] David Thomas: Batshit nonsense in any technical sense. A band that wouldn't make it out of a pub talent show today. The worst symptom of the 7 album deal of the music industry of the past
[10/24/25, 8:19:14 AM] Rory Edwards: And yet Sleaford Mods exist. Bizarre.

[10/24/25, 11:22:05 AM] Rory Edwards: So bonus ball and all that.
[10/24/25, 11:33:08 AM] Neil Tilston: Glad it went down well with you. As I say it's my favourite new one from them in years. Mature but not boring
[10/24/25, 11:34:23 AM] Neil Tilston: I like the idea of the fall more than the reality sometimes. I enjoyed for about half the runtime but I think hey we're best as a live act or for the impact of a single with that snarl on a playlist/radio show. It'd be very rare I actually choose to listen to a fall album
[10/24/25, 11:35:23 AM] Neil Tilston: But I'm not standing for this pub band slander. Mark may have treated them poorly but he consistently surrounded himself with musicians who could really play and I think the band make a wonderful racket!
[10/24/25, 11:37:05 AM] Neil Tilston: I enjoyed listening to this and while I applaud it's ambition I can't say I loved it. Pretty rough subject matter makes it pretty challenging and there's no way I'm agreeing with you that this is better than transformer - his masterpiece imo
[10/24/25, 11:38:37 AM] Neil Tilston: This was the absolute pick of the week for me and one of my favourite ever choices for album club. It's dense,  ambitious, exciting and frequently breathtaking. All totally new music to me. Clearly a huge amount of love and knowledge of this music has led to such a well curated compilation.

All the stars
[10/24/25, 11:41:11 AM] Neil Tilston: Elk, Peter Wale, Cindy Ritzer, Sorahan and Smokey among the standout tracks for me. I'm on my third listen now although I've put each of those tracks on repeat at times this week as well.

[10/29/25, 1:55:17 PM] Rory Edwards: Best Halloween pick ever. Like zombie Joe Strummer and vampire Elvis started a band in a graveyard.
[10/29/25, 1:59:46 PM] Rory Edwards: It does occasionally have a britpoppy vibe. I don't think it's a masterpiece but it thrums along nicely and is particularly good when it builds to a fat finish. I like Shadow of the Season and Troubled Times in that regard.
[10/29/25, 2:44:31 PM] Neil Tilston: I was a bit disappointed. I hoped for a lot more edge with that band name and from what I know of mark lannegan. Felt very polished (presumably aiming for MTV recognition at the time) but definitely sounded sanitised in comparison to other picks
[10/29/25, 2:45:20 PM] Neil Tilston: I think I've come to the conclusion that I'm not really a fan of grunge and that nirvana are first and foremost a punk band which is why I like them so much despite being known as grunge
[10/30/25, 9:59:11 AM] Rory Edwards: It definitely is a bit MTV but I enjoy it nonetheless. Very much an album of it's time. I agree that Nirvana aren't really like the stuff they were meant to flag bearers for.
[10/30/25, 9:59:22 AM] Rory Edwards: A lot of grunge is folk dealing with standard young adult problems. Kurt sadly had a whole other set of deeper problems.

[10/30/25, 1:59:58 PM] Rory Edwards: The first 20 times at least. Both of ours are at it. Naomi from the girls crew and Fraser from the rival denomic boy band.
[10/30/25, 2:41:53 PM] Fergus Neville: Finlay learnt something similar for school recently. He performed it for us and Dee and I agreed it was the most racist sounding accent we’d ever heard.

To somehow simultaneously run several of the world's most successful grifts and be the second biggest asshat among English speakers, all while spending most of your time live steaming yourself playing diablo while in the khole is an incredible achievement when you think about it. ‎<This message was edited>

[11/3/25, 2:18:37 PM] Neil Tilston: They discussed it a lot in the second half of this radio show. They also played a track from your comp from there other week Dave as I'd recommended it to one of the presenters who loved it
[11/3/25, 7:15:07 PM] David Thomas: thats me! Very nice of you to credit the recommendation Neil!
[11/4/25, 1:39:34 AM] Neil Tilston: Of course. It was a great pick!
[11/6/25, 3:45:17 PM] Rory Edwards: Ok I've got some opinions on music this week.
[11/6/25, 3:47:37 PM] Rory Edwards: I thought this was really good. Atmospheric, lovelorn alt-country, you can practically picture the saloon. Draws you in close. Thought I was getting bored then it finished and it started again and I found out I wasn't.

[11/6/25, 3:51:58 PM] Rory Edwards: The fact that Robert Plant is still making music this high quality is kinda incredible. It's got to be enjoyed for it's own sake though as it's not very deep lyrically. Think this record is beat when he duets, didn't get on with Soup of Man, but it mainly sounds awesome though and that's the main thing.
[11/6/25, 3:57:34 PM] Rory Edwards: Minorly disappointed by tumbleweeds for this so far as I think it's brilliant. Out of Mull and on Mogwai's label this lot have been shoegazey till now, when they seem to have heard Arab Straps last and decided they wanted to make a space age version of that instead. Pitch black beats building to a hopeful crescendo disconcertingly called 'The Noose'.
[11/6/25, 3:58:32 PM] Rory Edwards: It's my Scottish Album of the Year regardless of what your ceremony has to say 😜😘
[11/6/25, 3:59:40 PM] Rory Edwards: Despite enjoying her more than the average album club member I would not have bought a ticket for a musical about Lily Allen's love life, that hasn't changed.
[11/6/25, 4:01:39 PM] Rory Edwards: Seems I like the veil of mistique Taylor gives the same trick as found this much too literal and on the nose.
[11/6/25, 4:02:43 PM] Rory Edwards: It had some decent tunes on it but found it a bit all over the place musically and not invested in the story enough to go deeper.
[11/6/25, 4:02:49 PM] Rory Edwards: Wouldn't mess with her though.
[11/6/25, 4:05:08 PM] Rory Edwards: Enjoy the ceremony tonight lads and the gig tomorrow. Very jealous.

[11/6/25, 6:40:18 PM] Fergus Neville: One of this group has previously declared a KT Tunstall duet to be “the best live song” they’d ever witnessed. Any guesses who said that @⁨Neil Tilston⁩? 🤫

[11/7/25, 5:35:04 AM] Fergus Neville: Free bar Thursdays should be banned
[11/7/25, 5:35:35 AM] Fergus Neville: Actually it's more that I can't manage late nights and early starts anymore 🥱
[11/7/25, 5:36:50 AM] Fergus Neville: Kev from Big Rock Records works at Dundee Leisure and Culture. He co-wrote the bid to bring SAY to Dundee, and mentioned BRR in the application. So we're an officially recognised partner which means guest tickets and the ability to host a fringe event (our gig on Saturday)
[11/7/25, 5:37:24 AM] David Thomas: That's sweet
[11/7/25, 5:38:53 AM] Fergus Neville: Can't blame Plant too much for the lyrics given that they're all covers 😂
[11/7/25, 5:40:09 AM] Rory Edwards: Ha, my biggest issue with the 'soul of man' thing was that I was sure I had heard the same thing ten times before 🤣
[11/7/25, 5:43:03 AM] David Thomas: I also enjoy Lilly Allen, and thought this was great - not good, but stripped back and beats all over the place, and on the nose - all the things I'm looking for in an album to be interesting basically. Very much uncomfortable to listen knowing  it's real life - although maybe tongue in cheek at his expense in parts, but what a fantastic way to get back at somone!  A one off listen for sure, although they are playing the one about the mortgage on the radio
[11/7/25, 5:43:39 AM] David Thomas: Does Ferg not like KT? Why not??
[11/7/25, 5:45:17 AM] Fergus Neville: I once suggested that booking someone slightly more poppier than our usual acts - giving KT Tunstal as an example - might help shift a few more tickets for our festival. Since then Neil has decided that I am a "super fan". 😂
[11/7/25, 5:46:47 AM] Fergus Neville: Although last night she did throw her sweaty towel off stage right at Neil. He caught it, was embarrassed, and hung it on my shoulder. There was an akward pause before our friend Kev2 handed it to some actual fans who were overjoyed.
[11/7/25, 8:57:49 AM] Fergus Neville: Are we allowed to pick singles today @⁨Neil Tilston⁩? Do they all have to be from Eye to the Telescope?
[11/7/25, 9:29:06 AM] Neil Tilston: Yep whatever you like

[11/7/25, 12:05:49 PM] Neil Tilston: Your Scottish album of the year is by a band from Hull? 🤨
[11/7/25, 12:12:44 PM] Neil Tilston: I agree with his review mostly though. They started out with quite a harsh shoegaze sound - I enjoyed their gig in Dundee a couple of years ago but had found the records quite dense. This one was pleasantly melodic and reminded me of Mogwai's happy songs for happy people album.
[11/7/25, 12:12:58 PM] Rory Edwards: The boy who recommended it told me they were from Mull 🤣
[11/7/25, 12:14:15 PM] Rory Edwards: It was quite loud though. Definitely not my hearings fault etc

[11/7/25, 12:18:28 PM] David Thomas: Ooh nice
[11/7/25, 12:18:38 PM] Neil Tilston: So I don't think you realise but you suggested her for Lughnasadh year one. And the big rock collective kicked it about for a bit but kind of agreed we were keen to promote artists whose best work was being made right now and that legacy acts like KT Tunstall while being a lot of fun are maybe more suited to a festival like Belladrum than ours.

A year later I arrived just before you to the meeting planning the second lineup and joked something along the lines of "what are the odds Fergus pushes for KT Tunstall again?" Jokingly referencing the previous conversation. You then did so very early in the meeting. Hence the hilarity and it sticking!
[11/7/25, 12:20:05 PM] Neil Tilston: I'm expecting it to be your first suggestion again this time round as it now feels like a tradition
[11/7/25, 12:20:35 PM] Neil Tilston: I know Rory will ask us to pick BDRM as their the greatest Scottish band of our generation
[11/7/25, 12:20:51 PM] Fergus Neville: (Although I've already made cases for Pictish Trail, The Cords, and Roller Disco Death Party!)
[11/7/25, 12:21:22 PM] Rory Edwards: If The Guardian decides the SAY award they would be right up there I'm sure.
[11/7/25, 12:21:37 PM] Fergus Neville: The Mull/Hull fiasco coupled with Plant's poor lyrics on his cover album have brightened my day. Keep up the good work @⁨Rory Edwards⁩!
[11/7/25, 12:24:01 PM] Rory Edwards: You're doing a valuable service in reading the album sleeves for me lad, I'll just listen to the music 😘
[11/7/25, 12:24:04 PM] Fergus Neville: Based on a record from 2016...
[11/7/25, 12:24:18 PM] Fergus Neville: Just realised this was a KT pick btw 😆
[11/7/25, 12:31:47 PM] Neil Tilston: I love how Fergus and I get one VIP invite to an industry event and then just start slagging everything David and Rory say! We love you really and promise not to be too big headed!

Late pick for Friday singles
[11/7/25, 12:49:07 PM] Fergus Neville: Love Adam’s new single (even if he did just text to rubber us for tomorrow)
[11/7/25, 12:49:21 PM] Neil Tilston: Adam Ross goes Super Furryesque
[11/7/25, 12:49:46 PM] Neil Tilston: Does he not know we're big shots now?
‎[11/7/25, 12:50:27 PM] Neil Tilston: ‎GIF omitted
[11/7/25, 12:51:11 PM] Fergus Neville: He was very grateful, but said they already had plans to see pals. I said he could bring them too and have had no reply so it might have just been an excuse
[11/7/25, 12:51:38 PM] Fergus Neville: Tbf it’s his only night not touring so probably wants a quiet one not driving around to gigs
[11/7/25, 1:04:39 PM] Rory Edwards: I had almost forgotten. Since it's my theme let's have critically acclaimed albums for our two freshly minted big shots.
[11/7/25, 1:05:01 PM] Rory Edwards: Think albums Adam Ross wouldn't like because he's hanging out with his cooler friends.
[11/7/25, 1:05:56 PM] Rory Edwards: (Only kidding lads, about the jibes not the theme, which is critically acclaimed albums)

[11/7/25, 1:07:14 PM] Rory Edwards: Give stars from the Guardian and in multiple languages. Adam Ross would hate it.
[11/7/25, 1:18:44 PM] Fergus Neville: This is going to be a week of tough listens isn’t it?
[11/7/25, 1:19:52 PM] Neil Tilston: So this is for albums that are critically acclaimed but we don't like?
[11/7/25, 1:20:27 PM] David Thomas: But only from big shots
[11/7/25, 1:22:15 PM] Neil Tilston: Ok there's an artist/album who was on the SAY shortlist that loads of people I respect love and has been very critically lauded. I don't really get it tbh so I'll use this theme as an opportunity to try again...

[11/10/25, 11:10:26 AM] Fergus Neville: Winner of the Scottish Album of the Year Award (and a new one to me)
[11/10/25, 11:10:57 AM] Fergus Neville: You know it's critically acclaimed, because it has a track called "late night jazz chat (interlude)"
[11/10/25, 11:12:02 AM] Neil Tilston: *you know the driving force behind the band has mild autism because
[11/10/25, 11:12:46 AM] Neil Tilston: I must explain what this is to the audience and that it's not a proper track!
[11/10/25, 11:13:22 AM] Fergus Neville: I appreciate that candour. It's like noting "skit" in the title so it can be skipped without listening
[11/10/25, 11:21:16 AM] Fergus Neville: Bonus critical acclimation points for being sung in foreign
[11/10/25, 11:22:19 AM] Neil Tilston: *all the foreigns

[11/10/25, 1:48:41 PM] David Thomas: Super cool foriegn stuff going on here - was a little skeptical at the start, but totally drew me in. What's the back story for those of us too lazy to Google it?
[11/10/25, 2:03:17 PM] David Thomas: Bonus points for completely unnecessary Yves Tumor sweary cameo - that byork track is gorgeous until then
[11/10/25, 2:26:41 PM] Neil Tilston: Lux was described by a press release as exploring lyrical themes of "feminine mystique, transformation, and transcendence", and its songs are inspired both by Rosalía's romantic relationships and her relationship with God. Its track listing is split across four movements, with lyrics in fourteen languages—Rosalía's native Catalan and Spanish, along with Arabic, English, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Mandarin, Portuguese, Sicilian, and Ukrainian. Each language's lyrics correspond to the life of a different female saint. A significant portion of the album's creation, which took between two and three years overall, was dedicated to learning how to sing in the various languages. Rosalía often started songs by sketching out rough lyrics with Google Translate before taking her drafts to professional translators and phoneticians. Music critics and journalists generally classified Lux as either classical music or experimental pop music with classical influences.
[11/10/25, 2:29:35 PM] Neil Tilston: Imagine the conversation with the label

"Sorry folks this is going to take a couple of years longer than expected. Just need to learn how to sing in fourteen languages"
[11/10/25, 2:46:05 PM] David Thomas: this sounds like the police, if they were trying to be kind of like a hardcore band. I don't hate it, just not sure I see the point
[11/10/25, 4:08:51 PM] Neil Tilston: Agree with all of this
[11/11/25, 4:55:43 AM] Fergus Neville: Do all hip hop artists record their phonecalls with each other? It's kinda creepy.
[11/11/25, 9:25:10 AM] David Thomas: I don’t get why there’s a tribute to kobe on the scottish album of the year - its like a tribute to some obscure scottish footballer on a killer mike album
[11/11/25, 9:26:02 AM] David Thomas: got this up loud on the big speakers at home today, its outstanding
[11/11/25, 9:26:28 AM] Fergus Neville: "obscure" 😂

[11/11/25, 9:50:17 AM] Rory Edwards: It's stunning. Can't say I'll put it on every day but think it's a minor masterpiece. Definitely an art.
[11/11/25, 11:29:59 AM] Neil Tilston: The vocalist is from LA
[11/11/25, 11:30:11 AM] Fergus Neville: Now in Govan

[11/14/25, 6:04:35 AM] Rory Edwards: Woah-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oo there @⁨David Thomas⁩. No need to get worked up about it.
[11/14/25, 9:03:12 AM] Rory Edwards: I think this is class. The jazzy production is insanely tight, feel you can tell it has been played rather than just created. Getting more out of it lyrically on relistens. Great record and a worthy winner imo.
[11/14/25, 9:05:44 AM] Rory Edwards: I thought this was fine and had some highlights, usually more consistently loud tunes. Outside of that it failed to marry it's slick poppy vocal and hardcore moments together well enough - wavering between Bastille and Black Flag. Ultrapop a better example of this genre.
[11/14/25, 9:07:40 AM] Rory Edwards: I liked this without finding it a classic. The sound is rich and layered and I think at its best when it has room to breath, when it becomes very cinematic. The lyrically driven tunes not as strong. May be a grower though as enjoyed through twice on my run the other day.
[11/14/25, 9:09:21 AM] Rory Edwards: I think this album is stonking and an incredible achievement on a number of fronts - the languages,  getting it past her label, and the fact it grabs you almost immediately despite you not being able to understand a word of it.
[11/14/25, 9:10:15 AM] Rory Edwards: Marie will tell you non English media has to be legit amazing to get any kind of recognition in the English speaking world, and this has spades now with glowing reviews everywhere and no doubt a growing audience.
[11/14/25, 9:12:04 AM] Rory Edwards: The perfect marriage of pop, modern classical, concept and crazy. I fully expect a global superstar to try and ape it next record round. And occasionally someone would do a shouty sweaty bit, what's not to like?
[11/14/25, 9:34:49 AM] Fergus Neville: Excellent reviewing as always Rory 👏
[11/14/25, 9:39:44 AM] Neil Tilston: Great word Rory agree with you broadly on all. Will try and chip in more later x
[11/14/25, 1:18:10 PM] David Thomas: Total earworm. Been randomly shouting out “my BEER AND MY LAWNCHAIR” at the family all week, hope you guys are too
[11/14/25, 1:28:45 PM] Fergus Neville: You hadn’t added it to the playlist yet, so no
[11/14/25, 1:28:55 PM] Fergus Neville: (Sighs theatrically)
[11/14/25, 1:29:07 PM] David Thomas: I would but
[11/14/25, 1:29:56 PM] Fergus Neville: Decent excuse tbf
[11/14/25, 1:30:39 PM] Fergus Neville: Also, it is quite good
[11/14/25, 1:30:46 PM] Fergus Neville: Where is my mind vibes?
[11/15/25, 12:37:39 PM] Neil Tilston: Yeah it's really cool and gets better with each listen. Big harry Weir on sax is a total legend - plays in Rebecca Vasmant ensemble and sometimes corto.alto
[11/15/25, 12:38:14 PM] Neil Tilston: Yeah I don't get these guys massive appeal. At times it reminds me of recent foo fighters. 2/5
[11/15/25, 12:39:58 PM] Neil Tilston: Agree on your words on this. I like the aesthetic of it all but there's just a lack of something to really grab me in it. It's all very nice and everything but where's the standout track? The breathtaking lyric?the subtle refrain that creeps in your memory. I'm not saying it's bad but I don't personally (yet) get why it's so adored by many folk I respect ‎<This message was edited>
[11/15/25, 12:40:57 PM] Neil Tilston: Yeah it's a pretty awesome record and fully realised. An incredible album
[11/15/25, 12:56:40 PM] Neil Tilston: Bit worried about @⁨David Thomas⁩ cheerily singing a song about wanting to die to his family
[11/16/25, 4:05:51 AM] Neil Tilston: Do we have/need a new theme?
[11/16/25, 9:08:00 AM] Neil Tilston: https://www.mixcloud.com/live/jamradio/

[11/16/25, 10:19:30 AM] Neil Tilston: TITzer or Ti(t)zer?
[11/16/25, 10:20:13 AM] David Thomas: TITS!Er

[11/17/25, 3:01:15 AM] Neil Tilston: 👀
[11/17/25, 8:43:41 AM] David Thomas: Ah, sorry guys!
[11/17/25, 8:45:11 AM] David Thomas: Free choice given the lateness of the theme!
[11/17/25, 9:30:43 AM] Neil Tilston: https://tidal.com/browse/album/633335?u
[11/17/25, 9:31:49 AM] Neil Tilston: FYI I'm on a 60 day trial with Tidal (only cost £2). I'm expecting to delete Spotify completely at the end of this two months unless tidal proves to be a problem in that time
[11/17/25, 9:32:29 AM] Neil Tilston: Ideally I'm done with Spotify so you'll need to update your playlists there yourselves if you're staying there
[11/17/25, 9:33:18 AM] Neil Tilston: I don't know what will happen to collaborative playlists I created if/when I delete my account
[11/17/25, 9:34:00 AM] David Thomas: Hmm
[11/17/25, 9:34:16 AM] David Thomas: Deleting for idiological reasons?
[11/17/25, 9:35:27 AM] Neil Tilston: Primarily yeah.

Investment in war tech and rates for musicians. To the best of my knowledge tidal aren't doing the former and in terms of the latter while still not great they play roughly 3-4x more per stream to the artist than Spotify.
[11/17/25, 9:36:07 AM] Neil Tilston: Other option is Qobuz who are better ethically but I'm worried about their library size being smaller meaning I won't be able to listen to smaller artists.
[11/17/25, 9:37:07 AM] Neil Tilston: FYI 98% of tracks/albums from my Spotify library (including my 300+ playlists) were on tidal. It was very easy to copy them over.
[11/17/25, 9:38:21 AM] Neil Tilston: And when I've searched the missing ones (eg Dundee band Jutebox) many of them are in fact on Tidal I just think because they're a bit obscure they're not indexed as well for the software I used to find them. ‎<This message was edited>
[11/17/25, 9:38:50 AM] Rory Edwards: If Tidal has the artists I'm keen to look at it.
[11/17/25, 9:39:19 AM] Neil Tilston: I'm experimenting so happy to give updates. Interface seems similar to Spotify if a little more basic.
[11/17/25, 9:51:38 AM] Neil Tilston: It's worth noting of course that tidal has music Spotify doesn't as well as the other way round. Nothing has everything anyway so Spotify if already limited
[11/17/25, 10:16:15 AM] David Thomas: I think one of us can just copy your playlists to keep them from getting nuked once your account gets deleted. Would be nice to have a platform agnostic solution going forward tho for playlists and sharing - happy to put some work into this if you can give me a week or so.
[11/17/25, 10:35:39 AM] Fergus Neville: I'll have a crack at this now - I have a month's free access to Lovable after going on a course which should be able to do this

[11/17/25, 2:17:45 PM] Rory Edwards: Enjoyed this a lot bridging the gap to the new theme. Excited to listen to the new Fergus Mccreadie stuff. Bizarrely the artist Marie has seen play love most this past year. Strange chanting tho g not so enjoyable. Who would have thought Pete Tong and Florence would go so well together?
[11/17/25, 2:27:30 PM] Rory Edwards: Fun they decided to subtitle it.
[11/17/25, 2:44:20 PM] Neil Tilston: Strange chanting?
[11/17/25, 2:54:41 PM] Fergus Neville: Here's a first attempt
[11/17/25, 2:54:44 PM] Fergus Neville: https://albumclubplaylists.lovable.app/
[11/17/25, 2:55:32 PM] Rory Edwards: There was an organ heavy tune near the end that went on about Titus Andronicus for a bit. It was really rhythmic and random.
[11/17/25, 2:55:59 PM] Fergus Neville: It should update as we add stuff to Spotify so that if anyone stops using Spotify they can still check the playlist. The next step would be to see if we can edit it using the page, or update somehow automatically from two or more different apps. At which point @⁨David Thomas⁩ might be needed to supplment but crappy efforts! ‎<This message was edited>

[11/18/25, 2:11:52 PM] David Thomas: This is also lovely! What's with the giraffes song? Is it a frank Turner track? Or did he cover this guy?
[11/18/25, 2:28:14 PM] Rory Edwards: He covered this guy.

[11/18/25, 2:31:53 PM] Rory Edwards: Pretty damn dark in places but I think he really brings out the character of London. Girrafes #1 is great because it somehow manages to.be both whimsical and poetic.
[11/18/25, 2:44:04 PM] David Thomas: had this on in my office yesterday and a bunch of folks came in to work on something that they needed my help to fix - it might be the coolest i’ve ever looked/sounded in my life

[11/20/25, 11:48:12 AM] Rory Edwards: Contributed to some incredible music.
[11/20/25, 12:15:01 PM] Fergus Neville: No way! He’d just announced a speaking tour including to Dundee.

[11/21/25, 5:24:48 AM] Fergus Neville: Can you make the AC playlists collaborative so that I can add in a track from each album? It's the best way we have to keep track on what we've (not) had

[11/21/25, 6:16:08 AM] Rory Edwards: I have always just been in the habit of scrolling back.
[11/21/25, 6:17:01 AM] Rory Edwards: This record has loads of great tunes in it, many miles ahead of their time. I don't find it all that consistent tone wise by still a solid 8/10 for me. Reminds me of the best Aphex Twin stuff in places. ‎<This message was edited>
[11/21/25, 6:18:21 AM] Rory Edwards: Thought this was ok. Strokes meets LCD Sound system which sounds amazing as a concept, but it doesn't have the depth for me and only really hits the heights on Radar Detector.
[11/21/25, 6:19:56 AM] Rory Edwards: A lovely record with a keen sense of melody and and excellent harmonies. Lyrical content is hardly groundbreaking but if it sounds so pretty it's hard to moan.
[11/21/25, 6:22:26 AM] Rory Edwards: Love it when what is essentially a folk singer gets their proper band moment and this is Chris TTs. Those 320 giraffes deserve their time in the sun.

[11/21/25, 7:18:57 AM] Neil Tilston: That link should allow you to collaborate on the playlist.


BUT
as I created the playlist it's possible that when I delete my account (probably mid January) the playlist may vanish from Spotify
[11/21/25, 7:19:18 AM] Neil Tilston: Honestly don't know
[11/21/25, 7:19:27 AM] Neil Tilston: Honestly not my problem 😂
[11/21/25, 7:26:48 AM] Fergus Neville: Agree with this. I wish someone hadn't claimed it sounded like LCD as that raised my expectations! The vocals were very Julian Casablancas though. Sounded like a late Strokes record with a couple of great tracks but most passed me by.
[11/21/25, 9:21:22 AM] Neil Tilston: I'll continue to update my playlist here x

[11/22/25, 5:39:47 AM] Neil Tilston: Definitely of it's time. A cool record. Sorry I ruined it for you!
